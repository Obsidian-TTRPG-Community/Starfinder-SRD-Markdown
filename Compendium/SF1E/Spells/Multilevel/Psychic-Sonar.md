## Description

You project a sonar-like blast of psychic energy that rebounds a moment later. Creatures in the spell’s area each attempt a Will save. Those who fail take the full damage, and until the end of your next turn, you can sense those creatures as though you had blindsense (thought) with a range equal to the spell’s range. Those who succeed take half damage and can’t be detected with the spell’s blindsense effect. During your next turn, you can repeat this spell’s effect once without spending an action; however, the cone instead must originate from one of the creatures you can sense with the spell’s blindsense effect (and doesn’t include that creature in the spell’s area). You’re immune to your own psychic sonar, and this spell has no effect on creatures without an Intelligence score.
