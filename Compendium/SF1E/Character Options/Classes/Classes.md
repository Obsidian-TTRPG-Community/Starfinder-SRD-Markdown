# Classes

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 126_
From the cunning [[Operative]] to the deadly [[Soldier]], each core class in the Starfinder Roleplaying Game draws upon a central idea common to many characters found in science fantasy settings. However, there is a vast universe of interesting and useful character concepts beyond those easily represented by the existing classes. Players can emulate some of these concepts by choosing specific class features, selecting an appropriate theme (see page 28), or multiclassing (see page 26) to combine elements from more than one class. However, other concepts demand changes to a character’s focus that are beyond the scope of the standard classes and themes. To encompass these major differences, your character can take an archetype—a set of alternate class features that alters or replaces class features you would otherwise gain at specific levels.

An archetype is a character concept more specific and involved than a theme, but not as comprehensive or broad as a class. Each archetype represents a significant divergence from the abilities of a typical member of the core classes. Archetypes provide an additional layer of control for players who want to fine-tune their character’s advancement.

An archetype generally grants abilities that aren’t otherwise available to characters through a class, or it may grant easier access to a specific set of appropriate abilities. In general, these abilities aren’t tied to the background of any one core class or theme and aren’t available to characters via other sources. For example, the phrenic adept archetype (see page 128) could be used for a character who is naturally psychic or who gained psychic powers after being exposed to strange alien technology. Without a similar background or event, other characters can’t gain these powers, making it more appropriate for an archetype than a series of class features.

## Gaining an Archetype

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 126_
You can gain an archetype when you achieve a new class level in an eligible class matching the earliest level for which the archetype offers an alternate class feature. The archetype is then considered part of the class you gain a level in when you level up. For example, if you are playing an [[Envoy]] interested in being a [[Starfinder Forerunner]], you must select that archetype when you gain your 2nd level of [[Envoy]] (the first level at which the Starfinder forerunner has an alternate class feature). From that point forward, whenever you gain an envoy class level, you should check whether you gain an alternate class feature from the Starfinder forerunner archetype, as well as whether any envoy class features are altered or replaced. When you first gain an archetype, read through all the altered or replaced class features that will affect your character, and note these down; for some classes (especially mystics and technomancers) these changes affect features from levels before or after the levels at which you gain archetype features.

You cannot add the same archetype to multiple classes if you multiclass. For example, if a 2nd-level vesk envoy has selected the Starfinder forerunner archetype and later decides to multiclass and gain levels in the soldier class, the character cannot add the Starfinder forerunner archetype to his soldier class. Every time he gains soldier levels, he follows the normal character progression. If the character later gains more levels in envoy, that class continues to have the Starfinder forerunner archetype attached to it.

You also cannot add more than one archetype to a specific class. For example, once you have added the Starfinder forerunner archetype to the envoy class, you cannot add any other archetype to that class. If you multiclass and gain a level in a new class, you can add a new archetype to that class when you reach the appropriate level.

When an archetype refers to class level, it is referring to the number of levels you have in the class associated with the archetype.

## Alternate Class Features

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 126_
An archetype grants alternate class features that replace or alter class features normally granted by your class at one or more levels. The possible levels at which an archetype might grant an alternate class feature are 2nd, 4th, 6th, 9th, 12th, and 18th. An archetype might grant alternate class features at a few of these levels or at all of them.

Each class has a specific list of the class features that are altered or replaced, as defined in each class’s replaced class features entry. For example, an envoy who selects the Starfinder forerunner at 2nd level gains the trained for trouble class feature granted by the Starfinder forerunner instead of the envoy improvisation normally gained at 2nd level.

In some cases, a character gains a class feature at a later level than she would normally, rather than not gain it all. In these cases, a different class feature is generally replaced at the level the delayed class feature is now acquired. For example, a mechanic who has an archetype with a 9th-level alternate class feature does not gain the override class feature until 10th level. When this character’s mechanic class level reaches 10th, she gains the override class feature, but she doesn’t gain the mechanic trick normally gained at that level.

## Other Considerations

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 126_
While having an archetype may represent your training with or membership in a specific faction, having the archetype is generally not required for you to be considered part of a faction. For example, the Starfinder forerunner (see page 129) is specifically for characters who are part of the Starfinder Society and who have received special training for participation in Starfinder expeditions. However, it is not necessary to take this archetype in order to become a member of the Starfinder Society. The archetype represents only one possible path within the society, not the sole choice for characters tied to that faction.

Archetypes can generally be added to any class, though some archetypes might note they are available only to specific classes or might have other prerequisites you must meet to select them. For example, an archetype that represents training in a specific magic tradition might be available only to mystics and technomancers, while an archetype designed for devotees of an ancient monastery’s fighting techniques might be available only to solarians and soldiers. An archetype notes in its description whether it has any prerequisites or restrictions.

## Class Guide

**Face**: Envoy, Solarians, Operative, Witchwarper
**Skills**: Biohacker, Envoy, Mechanic, Operative, Solarian
**Spellcaster**: Mystic, Precog, Technomancer, Witchwarper
**Healing**: Biohacker, Envoy, Mystic, Nanocyte, Precog

### **BIOHACKER**

The Biohacker is an Intelligence or Wisdom-based Doctor class. Using the various Injection weapons that _Starfinder_ has, the Biohacker applies boons (Boosters) or banes (Inhibitors) to allies and enemies. Biohackers specialize in these unique “injection” weapons, and thus suffer on the damage side. To compensate, they apply massive defensive buffs to allies, or brutally penalize their foes. Rather than having spell slots to help their utility, the Biohacker is completely reliant on their incredible Intelligence and skills for out-of-combat performance.

In terms of build paths, the Biohacker tends to either focus on buffing their allies or making enemies easier to deal with. The Biohacker may either use Intelligence or Wisdom for their effects; Intelligence Biohackers are able to combine their effects and are better when prepared. Wise biohackers are more focused on buffing their targets, such as removing conditions.

Otherwise, a Biohacker may wish to focus on their field of study. These range from Genetics – a buffing archetype focused on altering a creature’s genetic makeup – to Toxicology – with abilities focused on lessening the pain of poisons while amplifying an enemy’s sickness. Thankfully, as a Biohacker levels up, they do get alternate fields of study. You’re not just stuck as a pharmacist the entire campaign!

### ENVOY 
The Envoy is a Charisma-based diplomat or ruffian, who use their extraordinary talent with skills to influence a fight without ever shooting a gun. The Envoy chooses a select subsection of skills which they gain a _massive_ bonus to roll with. Then, when they enter combat, they use the skills they specialize in to bamboozle enemies and inspire their allies. They’re basically the Bards of _Starfinder_… But with _no_ spells! You’re just a massive pile of natural talent.

Envoys don’t have any specific class archetypes or pathways to choose. Instead, they are essentially a specialist in a singular skill, such as Diplomacy or Medicine. All Envoys are innately great at Sense Motive. As a hyper-focused support, they must use their skill expertise very liberally during combat. The Envoy can gain a few extra Expertise skills, but they tend to focus on a single skill that they are _godly_ at.

They expand their expertise in two directions. 

- Envoys learn **Improvisations**, skills during combat which are small support buffs that the Envoy can use very often. Envoys are capable of granting bonuses to attack, handing out extra actions, and granting temporary health. And, as they level up, these improvisations become more varied and innately powerful.
- They also learn **Expertise Talents**. They take their Expertise Skills in skills that they are specialized in. This grants them brand new ways to use their skills in ways that other classes could only _dream_ of.

### **MECHANIC**

The Mechanic is an Intelligence-based genius with computers. They are essentially the Rangers of _Starfinder_, but it is not really that fair of a comparison. To start, they gain a Custom Rig, capable of improving their own personal ability by augmenting their body or by creating a small drone that they control like a pet. The Mechanic is a genius hacker, able to alter mechanisms and technology in ways no other classes can do innately. In a tech-heavy setting, the Mechanic is as much a miracle worker as any magic user could possibly be!

The custom rig is the largest part of their combat power. You choose one of these two options;

- **Exocortex** are augmentations to the Mechanist themself. This allows them to be significantly more accurate with weapons, and grants them access to computer tech and hacking ability without needing to carry a computer on them.

- **Drones** are beefy, powerful pets that the Mechanic has full control over. The Mechanist has a lot of different chassis to choose from – light fliers, stealthy camo bots, and bulky bruiser droids. These will serve as acceptable frontliners and great scouts.

Other than your basic class, all Mechanics learn Tricks. These tricks offer minor utility benefits both inside and outside of combat. These minor actions are essential to remember to ensure a Mechanic makes the use out of any given combat situation.

### **MYSTIC**

The Mystic is the Wisdom-based Cleric substitute of _Starfinder_. Pulling from the forces that be, the Mystic is one of the few spellcasters in the system. They have innate healing with just a touch, as well as level 6 Spell Slots. Of course, they aren’t great with guns… But, their magic can more than make up for how gently they hit with pistols.

The big selling point of the Mystic is Connections. For any players of 5E, these are domains; the Mystic’s connection to the universe grants them innate powers that improve their spellcasting, grant them impressive knowledge in two skills, and grants them extra abilities.

The connections are as follows:

- **Akashic:** The Knowledge option with rerolls.

- **Crusader:** A frontline bruiser.

- **Delusion:** An enchanter focused on confusion.

- **Devastator:** A hybrid caster that uses magic to fuel attacks.

- **Empath:** A traditional all-round support build.

- **Flamewalker:** A fire-based archetype. Mostly defensive.

- **Geneturge:** A buff-based option that can transform.

- **Healer:** A massive healer, focused on keeping others alive.

- **Hive Mind:** A buffer that relies on a telepathic connection to allies.

- **Melophile:** An enchanter able to buff allies like a Bard.

- **Mindbreaker:** A mental assassin with surprising defensive abilities.

- **Overlord:** An enchanter focused on dominating brains.

- **Shadow:** A defensive build focused on hiding and sowing chaos in a fight.

- **Shaper:** The Creation-based Connection.

- **Star Shaman:** An all-rounder blaster, mobility, and reroll archetype.

- **Trailblazer:** A mobility and exploration connection that connects to their environment.

- **Warmonger:** A weapon-driven connection with great summoning capabilities.

- **Xenoambassador:** A diplomat.

- **Xenodruid:** A naturalist. Great lockdown and defensive abilities.

### **NANOCYTE**

The most recent class, the Nanocyte is a Constitution-based frontliner with nearly infinite utility. Capable of separating their body into a swarm of robots, they are hard to put down and highly influential in a fight.

The main mechanics of the Nanocyte are the Arrays and Nanite Surge. The Arrays are; Sheath Array, improving their durability and skills; Cloud Array, which causes a small miss chance and allows you to safely move inside of it; and Gear Array, which allows you to construct a specific set of technological items. As you level up, these arrays improve with you.

Outside of this, their main class abilities improve their durability, reduce damage from natural sources such as Bleed, and construct additional arrays. They can even die and revive once per day once they reach level 20, and revive an ally as well!

The Faculties of the Nanocyte change how they may use their arrays. The Faculties are as follows.

- **Discorporation:** The nanobots break down and reform, allowing the nanocyte to transform and heal easily.

- **Infestation:** The nanobots assault nearby enemies while in Sheath and Cloud array, allowing for impressive Area of Effect damage and counterhit damage.

- **Obliteration:** The nanobots improve the weapons of the Gear Array, dealing extra damage with greater accuracy.

- **Redirection:** The nanobots mess with enemies, allowing for more accurate attacks and the ability to use Cloud Array to move enemies around the battlefield.

- **Regeneration:** The nanobots are trained to heal the nanocyte and nearby allies, and can do so with ease, even capable of reviving the target.

### **OPERATIVE**

The Operative is the Dexterity-based spy and assassin of _Starfinder_. They have incredible abilities with skills, and get a massive bonus to all skills. They use this bonus to perform Trick Attack, a special action which adds a large amount of damage to attacks with small weapons or Dexterity-based weapons. However, to make a Trick Attack, they must make a pretty hard Bluff, Intimidate, or Stealth check.

Their Operative Specialization is crucial for their utility. These specializations determine what skill (other than Bluff) can be used to make a Trick Attack. They also have specific upsides to give the Operative an edge in combat. If that wasn’t enough, these skills gain a +3 bonus innately and automatically improve as the Op levels up! If the Specialization’s Trick Attack skill does not use Dexterity, the Operative gains a boost so that the Trick Attack is more likely to land.

- **Daredevil:** Acrobatics. Great mobility.

- **Detective:** Sense Motive. Great lie-detection.

- **Disciple:** Mysticism. Great anti-mage.

- **Explorer:** Survival. Great fringe survivalist.

- **Gadgeteer:** Engineering. Great problem-solving.

- **Ghost:** Stealth. Great stealth and mobility.

- **Hacker:** Computers. Great hacking.

- **Spy:** Bluff. Great at disguising and subterfuge.

- **Thief:** Sleight of Hand. Great distractions and problem-solving.

With a whopping 10 base Skill Ranks per level (including the 2 for the Specialization), the Operative is fantastic both in and out of combat. To help them out, they gain access to Operative Exploits. These are minor ways to use Trick Attack or neuter enemies. 

### **SOLARIAN**

The Solarian is a Charisma-based Melee Bruiser; almost like the Monk of _Starfinder_, but _much_ beefier. With a stellar mote around their body, they can construct weapons, armors, or shields out of pure energy. During a fight, the Solarian’s body naturally tips back and forth between Graviton (tank) or Photon (damage) mode. While in one mode or another, the Solarian gains access to new abilities and bonuses.

Instead of class paths, the Solarian’s Solar Manifestation is the most important part of the solarian’s combat build. This cannot be changed.

- **Solar Armor:** You gain a bonus to AC while wearing light armor, and gives you innate resistance to either cold or fire.

- **Solar Weapon:** You manifest a weapon. This weapon scales while you level up, gaining additional dice, and can become the strongest melee weapon in the game!

- **Solar Flare:** You create a small solar flare, which acts like a pistol. This pistol deals a lot of damage, and scales fantastically with their level. It deals a lot less damage than their Melee Weapon option, but allows the Solarian to function as a ranged fighter.

- **Solar Shield:** You create a shield made of innate energy. This shield can grant a massive +6 bonus if a Move Action is spent to raise it against a target. It can also bash people real good!

- **Lunar Weapon:** Just like Solar Weapon, you make a weapon. However, this weapon is designed to use Dexterity to attack instead of Strength. Essentially, this allows for the Solarian to be a sneaky spy, rather than a brute.

Combined with Revelations, their Stellar Mode is critical for destroying their enemies and keeping their allies safe from harm.

### **SOLDIER**

Soldier is a basic striker class; think of the Fighter from _Pathfinder_ or _Dungeons & Dragons_. They are great with all weapons, all armor, and have quite a few builds to make those weapons great! This class is by far the weakest out-of-combat, but still with enough skills to survive in non-fighting situations. And it _more_ than makes up for it by being the most potent gunslinger in the game. It’s raw accuracy and damage!

The most important aspect of the Soldier is the combat style. Here’s a list of them;

- **Ambusher:** Use speed and tactical positioning to end a fight fast.

- **Arcane Assailant:** Use magical ability to bypass damage reduction and gain magical powers.

- **Armor Storm:** Use armor to wade through their opponents with ease.

- **Battlemaster:** Improvise during a fight to always have an advantage.

- **Blitz:** Use blinding speed to rush their opponents.

- **Bombard:** Hammer the battlefield with explosions and scattershot.

- **Fourfold Tactician:** Wields multiple weapons in a blinding flurry.

- **Gloom Gunner:** Attacks from the shadows to strike from nowhere.

- **Guard:** Uses their own body to protect their allies.

- **Hit-and-Run:** Use insane mobility to become a hybrid of ranged and melee offense.

- **Hunter:** Uses intense focus to track their opponents.

- **Pistol Dancer:** Uses small arms and great mobility on the battlefield.

- **Qi Adept:** Uses Qi disciplines to cultivate magical abilities.

- **Rover:** Uses knowledge of terrain to grant big advantages in fights.

- **Sharpshoot:** Uses sniper rifles to decimate fights.

- **Shock and Awe:** Overwhelms enemies with massive noises or flashing lights.

- **Silent Slayer:** Uses stealth to get the drop on a target.

- **Squad:** A team-based fighting style.

- **Wrathful Warrior:** A rage-focused, resource-oriented fighting style.

Other than these benefits, the Soldier learns to specialize in specific weapons and armor. They also gain _many_ combat [feats](https://www.nerdsandscoundrels.com/starfinder-feats/), and are thus able to fight in many, many different situations without missing a beat.

### **TECHNOMANCER**

The Technomancer is the Intelligence-based Arcane caster of the game. They have low health and poor natural proficiency with weapons. What’s more, they more than make up for this with an impressive spell list, capable of summoning weapons, objects, and the elements to their side. They have perhaps the best offensive spells of any of the spellcasters. 

In addition to magic, the Technomancer learns Magical Hacks. These hacks benefit the Technomancer by allowing them to perform some new activities without necessarily needing to have a spell known. There are a ton of Magic Hacks. But some impressive hacks include;

- **Adaptable Spell Knowledge** gives you more spells known.

- **Countertech**, which allows the Technomancer to counter technology attacks.

- **Empowered Weapon**, which allows you to improve a weapon’s attack and damage by spending a spell.

- **Fabricate Arms** lets you become a heavy-weapon bruiser for a moment, or a sniper.

- **Flash Teleport** gives you great mobility without spending spell slots.

- **Glitch Step** gives you some decent mobility.

- **Harmful Spells** add extra damage to their magic.

- **Selective Targeting** allows you to save their friends from magic.

Outside of magic, the Technomancer also becomes well-versed with both Computers and Mysticism, bridging the gap between the arcane and the science. Finally, they get to use their Cache in order to permanently cast some useful spells.

### **VANGUARD**

The Vanguard is a Constitution-based beefcastle of a tank. They are terrible at ranged combat, but make up for it with their innate durability. Their main mechanic, the Entropic Pool, is a resource that they build constantly during combat. This pool makes them harder to hit, and can be expended to improve their damage or grant you movement speed.

All Vanguards have access to the Entropic Strike, an attack that requires just a touch and deals damage based on their level. This Entropic Strike deals low damage until level 10, where it spikes dramatically! The Vanguard also gains the ability to use Combat Maneuvers against a slightly easier target.

Vanguards focus on an Aspect, which determines some of their Combat Control abilities. Here are the aspects that their Vanguard may adopt;

- **Boundary.** This aspect focuses on constructing barriers. You gain better Sunder abilities, higher Perception, and can mitigate damage quite easily.

- **Cascade.** This aspect focuses on change. You gain better Sunder abilities, higher Acrobatics, and can blind opponents and snowball debuffs on them.

- **Exergy.** This aspect focuses on potential. You gain better Trip abilities, higher Intimidate, and access to bonus damage and easier critical hits.

- **Inversion.** This aspect focuses on chaos. You gain better Reposition abilities, higher Medicine, and can heal hit points and stamina points.

- **Momentum.** This aspect focuses on motion. You gain better Bull Rush abilities, higher Culture, and can shove people and objects with nothing more than their mind.

- **Reaction.** This aspect focuses on natural reactions. You gain better Dirty Trick abilities, higher Physical Science, and can impose conditions and poison on their targets.

No matter what you choose, you get to take a ton of damage and still dish out alright numbers. You are the focus of every enemy, and you can stay in the spotlight all day.

### **WITCHWARPER**

The Witchwarper is the Charisma-based combat control caster of _Starfinder_. They are somewhat similar to a Sorcerer. However, Witchwarpers may use their spells to cause alternate realities to appear, causing a number of different effects to happen. This gives them innately useful abilities, and they can save their spell slots for offensive or situational spells.

The Witchwarper uses their gaze into the universes in order to improve skills, reroll d20s, and even rebuild their character on the fly.

The Witchwarper’s spells are the cream of the crop. They have a ton of utility spells and situational effects so that you can cover multiple situations. But, you are not helpless outside of their Spell Slots! The Witchwarper gains Paradigm Shifts, small abilities and actions that the Witchwarper can use to manipulate reality. These shifts tend to be focused around buffing allies, debuffing foes, or forcing creatures to reroll dice. Some good general ones include;

- **Eldritch Secret** for spells known.

- **Flash Teleport** to get great movement.

- **Inhibit** to slow targets down.

- **Magic Deletion** to save themself from magic.

- **Optimize** to gain access to haste for 1 Resolve.

- **Overlapping Forms** for durability improvements.

- **Prevent Wounds** for preemptive healing.

- **Shifting Immunity** to remove a creature’s immunity to damage.

- **Shift Resistance** to remove restrictive resistances.

- **Substitute Mind** to remove dangerous enchantments.

- **Swap Paradigms** to improve their utility.
