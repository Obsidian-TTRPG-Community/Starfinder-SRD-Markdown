# Null-space Kennel

A null-space kennel is a small device designed to be worn or strapped to clothing. This functions as a null-space chamber (Core Rulebook 227), opening a circular extradimensional rift into a pocket space when activated, closing that rift when activated again, and not increasing in bulk despite the pocket space’s contents. Whereas a null-space chamber can store virtually any object, a null-space kennel is designed to house and transport a willing pet or companion creature (Alien Archive 3 138), giving it enough room to relax, eat, and play in relative comfort. The maximum creature size and available air capacity of the pocket space depends on the model of null-space kennel. For every size category a creature is smaller than the null-space kennel’s maximum creature size, multiply the time the item can sustain the creature by 4. Other than its creature occupant, a null-space kennel can only store and close while containing items of a combined bulk that doesn’t exceed the device’s item level. While the device’s rift is open, the creature can leave freely, and the rift closes once it exits.  
When you purchase a null-space kennel, you can customize its interior, such as having it be a saltwater pool, woodland clearing, or indoor space. These features are entirely contained within the pocket space, even if you attempt to pour out the device’s contents. If you store UPBs in a null-space kennel, the device consumes a number of UPBs per day equal to twice its item level, using these to fabricate food and a variety of engaging toys for the creature inside. By spending 8 hours reconfiguring the device and expending UPBs worth 10% the device’s cost, you can change the interior features.
