A shock pad can be installed into an armor upgrade slot. When the user hits a target with the shock pad, the weapon emits an electric discharge that stuns or damages the target. These weapons are particularly valued in suits of powered armor that bring substantial strength to bear. Shock pads typically are available in static, aurora, storm, and tempest models.

# Shock Weapons

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weaponsâ€™ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
