## Description

Named for one of the mightiest mountain ranges on Vesk Prime, the Blood Mountain Clans’ Dmolangari-class combat supply ship is a near-ubiquitous vessel in both the Veskarium’s military and commercial navies. Since the end of the Silent War in 291 ag, the Dmolangari has regularly appeared hauling freight throughout the Pact Worlds as well as the Veskarium—a stark contrast to the feared Veskarium warships encountered in generations past.  
  
Though the ship was originally designed as a combat-capable support vessel for the Veskarium’s interstellar wars of conquest, a large share of existing Dmolangaris and their crews have taken up civilian contracts, making these starships some of the best-equipped freighters in current widespread use. The Veskarium military continues to use the Dmolangari in its original role and regularly updates its design, while also leveraging the peace afforded by the current Veskarium-Pact Worlds alliance to sell the ship on the civilian market.  
  
For all the tales of its invincibility, the Dmolangari struggles under certain circumstances. The starship is slightly too large to land safely on most planets, restricting it to docking with space stations or relying on smaller shuttles to ferry goods while the freighter remains in orbit. Additionally, some sites of the Veskarium’s failed conquests still associate these starships with bitter invasions, with saltier port authorities denying safe harbor to even the most peaceful Dmolangari crews.  
  
Heavily armored and shielded, the Dmolangari is primarily designed to be able to take a beating and still deliver its cargo in one piece, though it is more than capable of holding its own in battle. The Dmolangari can deliver a lethal punch to opponents with its capital-scale supermaser, while its aft gravity gun also doubles as a tractor beam for support duties like recovery, salvage, and towing. Turret-mounted torpedoes round out the Dmolangari’s armaments. The Dmolangari is also equipped with an integral shuttle bay—those in Veskarium military service usually a carry a single BMC Predator, giving each freighter its own defensive escort.  
  
In addition to the standard model, BMC also offers a transport variant of the Dmolangari, replacing the stock vessel’s cargo holds with passenger seating and giving it the capability to shuttle up to 96 combat-ready troops.
