The creature can fly through space at standard navigation and astrogation speeds using Piloting to navigate. If it uses a skill other than Piloting for skill checks to astrogate, that skill is listed in parentheses.

_Format_: **Other Abilities** spaceflight (Mysticism).  
_Guidelines_: Most creatures with spaceflight also have void adaptation.
