### DESCRIPTION

The Starfinder Society sells branded gear, of which the _Starfinder backpack_ is a prime example. People assume most _Starfinder backpacks_ come from the Lorespire Complex on Absalom Station, but more knock-offs exist than authentic ones.  
  
While wearing a _Starfinder backpack_, treat your Strength score as 4 higher for determining your carrying capacity. This increase doesn’t stack with other backpacks. When you seek an object stowed in the backpack, you find it immediately, allowing you to retrieve the object as if you were drawing a weapon. In addition, you can stow objects of 1 bulk or less in the pack as if you were sheathing a weapon.
