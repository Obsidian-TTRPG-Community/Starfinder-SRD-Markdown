# FEYGUARD

This armor gets its name from denizens of the First World, where the first sets were originally crafted. It’s said that no two sets of feyguard armor are the same, either due to the First World’s rapid fluctuations or the frequent alterations its mercurial fey manufacturers make on the production line. Feyguard is most commonly composed of materials that appear organically formed, and minor details seem to subtly shift in appearance during wear.
