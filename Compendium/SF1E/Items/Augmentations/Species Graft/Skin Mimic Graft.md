# Skin Mimic Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 146_  
**Level**:: 2
**Price**::  450 
**System**:: Skin  
Verthani can naturally alter the pigments in their skin, usually to create bright decorative patterns but sometimes to blend into their surroundings. With mere thought, you can control traces of potentiometric dye that have been injected throughout your skin. If you stay stationary for 1 round, you gain a +10 enhancement bonus to Stealth checks (this bonus doesn’t stack with the invisibility spell and similar effects). If you take any action, you lose this bonus until you once again spend 1 round remaining still. If you wear clothing or armor that covers more than one-quarter of your body, you can’t use this ability.
