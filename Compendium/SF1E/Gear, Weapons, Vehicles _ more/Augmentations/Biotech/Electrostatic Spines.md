# ELECTROSTATIC SPINES
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 59_  
**Item Level** 10; **Price** 18,000; **System** Skin  
These long, thin spines store and channel electrical energy generated by your own body, directing that electricity into objects in your hands. Any melee weapon you wield deals half its damage as electricity damage. This doesn’t change the Armor Class the weapon targets. In addition, any melee weapon you wield gains the staggered critical hit effect.
