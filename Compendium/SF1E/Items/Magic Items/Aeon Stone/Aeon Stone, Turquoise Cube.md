### Description

First seen in the back-alley gambling houses of Broken Rock, pirate crews have since carried these “luck stones” throughout the galaxy. Once per day as a reaction when you fail an attack roll, saving throw, or skill check by 1, this aeon stone can retroactively grant you a +1 bonus to the roll, turning the failure into a success.
