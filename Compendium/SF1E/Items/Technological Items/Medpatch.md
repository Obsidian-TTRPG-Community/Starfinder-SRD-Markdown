### Description

A medpatch is a simple, all-in-one, disposable medical device designed to be slapped onto a wound or area of concern (such as a clearly diseased or poisoned section of the body) with little skill required. A medpatch allows you to attempt a Medicine check untrained with a +10 circumstance bonus, but only for the first aid, long-term stability, treat disease, and treat drugs or poison tasks.
