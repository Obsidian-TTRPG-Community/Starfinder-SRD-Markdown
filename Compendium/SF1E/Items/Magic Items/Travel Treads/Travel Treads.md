The wandering deity Weydan breaks pieces of himself off into mortal avatars to explore and experience the Material Plane. The first _travel treads_ were gifts from such avatars bequeathed to fellow travelers. Followers of Weydan learned to create _travel treads_, and other organizations have copied the magic. _Travel treads_ come in pairs, most often already attached to shoes, boots, or similar gear. You wear the treads by affixing them to existing footwear. The treads count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.

While you wear _travel treads_, you reduce the amount of nonlethal damage you take from hustling and gain an enhancement bonus to Constitution checks when making a forced march. In addition, if you fail a saving throw against an effect that would render you dazed, entangled, paralyzed, prone, staggered, or stunned, or an effect that would reduce your movement speed, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the higher result. Alternatively, if an opponent succeeds at a combat maneuver to bull rush, grapple, reposition, or trip you, as a reaction you can force that attacker to reroll the attack, taking the lower result. Once you benefit from a given set of _travel treads_, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.

The exact benefits of _travel treads_ are based on their model, including the number of rerolls they provide per day, as follows.

[[Travel Treads, Mk 1]]

[[Travel Treads, Mk 2]]

[[Travel Treads, Mk 3]]
