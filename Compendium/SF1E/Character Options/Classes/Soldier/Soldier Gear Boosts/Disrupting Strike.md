desc:: Your weapons absorb ambient magic, potentially disrupting spellcasting. When you hit a target with an analog weapon, the target must attempt a Will save whenever they cast a spell before the beginning of your next turn. If they fail the save by 4 or less, the spell is weakened—treat its caster level as 2 lower, reduce any saving throw DC by 2, and the caster takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls with the spell. If they fail the save by 5 or more, the spell fails. Once a creature attempts a save against this gear boost, it’s immune to the ability for 24 hours.
