ABOUT

Grizzled mercenaries have been around long enough to know that being flashy only makes you a target and being prepared for anything keeps you alive. They carry many weapons for dealing with a variety of situations and prize utility above all else… except for credits. A grizzled mercenary is armed to the teeth and has survived wars and reckless adventurers. He carries multiple weapons so that he can deal with various types of foes and is unfazed by most encounters. He is loyal as long as he is paid well, but not willing to risk his life on an obvious suicide mission.
