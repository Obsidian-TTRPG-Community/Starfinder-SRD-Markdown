## Weapon Hatch

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 30_  
**Cost (in BP)** 1/3 × weapon cost  
**PCU** 4  
A weapon hatch conceals a single weapon mounted on the ship (until it’s fired). A science officer’s scan action reveals this weapon only on the 5th level of information discovery (instead of the 3rd).
