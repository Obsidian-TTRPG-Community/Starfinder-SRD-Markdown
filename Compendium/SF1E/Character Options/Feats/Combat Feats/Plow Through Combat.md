Benefit: You can attempt to move directly through another creature’s space as if using Acrobatics to tumble; however, you use the Athletics skill in place of Acrobatics, the DC equals 15 + 1-1/2 the creature’s CR, and succeeding avoids provoking attacks of opportunity from the creature you move past (not from others). If you instead use a standard action to use this feat, you move at your full speed, and if you succeed at the Athletics check, you treat the creature’s space as difficult terrain and deal damage to the creature equal to your base attack bonus plus your Strength modifier.
Prerequisites: Str 15, Athletics 3 ranks.
