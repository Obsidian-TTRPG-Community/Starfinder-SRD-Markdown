This shimmering circlet is crafted from rare metals and seems to bend and distort light around it, creating an eerie halo of light around your brow. Once per day, a _tiara of translocation_ allows you to teleport yourself and up to 5 additional creatures, functioning as a _teleport_ spell. Unlike the spell, the range at which you can use this item varies based upon its model, as described below. You cannot use a _tiara of translocation_ to travel between the planes, and it refuses to function at all while in the Drift.

| Type | Teleportation                         |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| Mk 1 | Any point within 200 miles            |
| Mk 2 | Any point within 2,000 miles          |
| Mk 3 | Any point within the same star system |
| Mk 4 | Any point within the same galaxy      |
