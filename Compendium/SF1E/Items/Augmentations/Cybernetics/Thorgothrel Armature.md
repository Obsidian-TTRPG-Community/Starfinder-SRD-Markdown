# Thorgothrel Armature

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 115_  
**Level**:: 11
**Price**::  25000 
**System**:: Spinal Column  
These sophisticated silvery rods replace key bones in your spine or other internal biological supports. The armature resonates with any armor upgrade you have installed in your armor, allowing you to spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to double the force field’s fast healing for 1 round.
