# MEMORY PRISM

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 123_  
**Classes** Mystic 4, Precog 4  
**School** divination  
**Casting Time** 1 minute  
**Range** personal  
**Duration** 24 hours (D)  

## DESCRIPTION

You copy one memory you have and cause it to crystallize into a small prism of negligible bulk. The memory can’t exceed 10 minutes in length, and the spell doesn’t work on memories that have been removed (such as with displace memoryCOM) or that you know have been magically altered (such as with modify memory). For the spell’s duration, any creature touching the crystal can observe the memory as if with share memory, though they witness 1 minute of memory per round spent reviewing the crystal’s contents.
