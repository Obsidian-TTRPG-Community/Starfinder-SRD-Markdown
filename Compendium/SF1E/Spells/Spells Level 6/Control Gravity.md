## Description

You can control gravity in an area, causing it to reverse, become zero-g, or become extremely strong. A creature or object within the area that succeeds at its saving throw is unaffected (though if it stays in the area, it must succeed at a new save each round or become affected), but it might still suffer secondary effects (such as an object flying up from reversed gravity, or an object falling upon it when the spell ends). You choose how to have this spell affect gravity when you cast it, and you cannot change it without recasting the spell. If two _control gravity_ spells affect the same area, they negate each other in the area of overlap.

If you reverse gravity in an area, you cause unattached objects and creatures in the area to fall upward and reach the top of the affected area in 1 round. If a solid object (such as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike it in the same manner as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature reaches the top of the spell’s area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, until the spell ends. At the end of the spell’s duration, affected objects and creatures fall downward. Creatures who can fly or levitate can keep themselves from falling in either direction.

If you increase gravity in the area, creatures and objects weigh twice as much as normal, move at half speed, can jump only half as far as normal, and can lift and carry only half as much as normal. Any flying target has its maneuverability worsened by one step (from average to clumsy, for example; minimum clumsy) and plummets to the ground unless it succeeds at a DC 25 Acrobatics check to fly to remain in the air.

An area of zero-g works like the zero gravity environment (see page 402). You can also use this spell to make areas of zero gravity, heavy gravity, or low gravity act as standard gravity for the duration (see page 402).
