# Troop Immunities (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Huskworld pg. 61_  
Troops are immune to the following effects, unless the effect specifies it works against swarms or troops.

-   Pinned, prone, staggered, and stunned.
-   Combat maneuvers—a troop can’t be subject to combat maneuvers, unless it’s affected by area effects that include such effects or the troop’s description says otherwise.
-   Flanking—troops are unflankable.
-   Dying—a troop reduced to 0 Hit Points breaks up and is effectively destroyed, though individual members of it might survive.

_Format_: **Immunities** troop immunities.
