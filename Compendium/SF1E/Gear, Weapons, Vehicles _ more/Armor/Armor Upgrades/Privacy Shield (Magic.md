These talismans embedded into armor plates constantly shield against divination magic and surveillance technology, per _nondetection_. This upgrade must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for a 24-hour cool-down period.
