Developed by kasathan engineers long ago to help them navigate the steep cliffs of their native Kasath, descent thrusters are miniature jets that slow your fall. You fall at a rate of only 60 feet per round, and you take no damage upon landing. You can trigger decent thrusters as part of an action when jumping down, or as a reaction if you fall.
