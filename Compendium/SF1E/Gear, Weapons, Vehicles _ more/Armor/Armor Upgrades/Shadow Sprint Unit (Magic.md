When activated as a full action, a shadow sprint unit shifts the armor and its wearer into the Plane of Shadow, as shadow walk. The voyage continues until you reach your destination and depart the Shadow Plane as a full action, or until the upgrade runs out of charges, at which point the upgrade shifts you to a nearby corresponding point on the Material Plane. A shadow sprint unit’s charges replenish each day.
