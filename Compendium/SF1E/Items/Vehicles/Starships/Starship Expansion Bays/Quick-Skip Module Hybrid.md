# Quick-skip Module (HYBRID)

**PCU** 10; **Cost (in BP)** 5  
Essentially a miniature onos drive, a quick-skip module can be activated at a moment’s notice to skip a starship forward a short distance. During the helm phase, as a crew action, a science officer can activate the quick-skip module by succeeding at a Computers check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the starship’s tier). If successful, the ship moves 1d3+2 hexes in the direction of its facing, moving safely past any obstacles or ships in its way. If this movement would end in a hex occupied by an object, including another ship, the skipping ship and the object take damage equal to 5 × the skipping ship’s tier, and the skip ends in the nearest unoccupied hex.
