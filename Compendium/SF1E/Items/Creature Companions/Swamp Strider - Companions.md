# SWAMP STRIDER - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 123_  
Lashuntas have a long tradition of riding swamp striders, though the practice has never approached the same prestige and telepathic bond as with the reptilian shotalashus. No doubt a part of this discrepancy stems from the sheer amount of maintenance required to raise and keep a swamp strider. Behaviorally, they’re finicky eaters and temperamental creatures that lash out at unfamiliar faces. Physically, their feet tend to dry and crack painfully in arid environments or against harder surfaces, requiring shoeing with polycarbonate or plastic laminate. What’s more, their coats require extensive maintenance to avoid developing an overpowering aroma. Collectively, their maintenance requirements inspired the term “swamp sovereign,” signifying a powerful yet painfully needy individual.

Even with these hurdles, swamp striders are a beloved curiosity. They most often appear in the lashunta strongholds of Asana, yet dozens of planets have also imported small populations of swamp striders.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Ferocious Charge (Ex)** When the creature charges, it can attempt a trip combat maneuver in place of the normal melee attack. In addition, the creature can charge without taking the normal charge penalties to its attack roll or AC. If the creature has another ability that allows it to charge without taking these penalties (such as the charge attack ability from the soldier’s blitz fighting style), it also gains the ability to charge through difficult terrain.  
**Marshborn (Ex)** A swamp strider can move through bogs without penalty to its normal speed.
