Effect: With the _deafening_ fusion, a weapon releases a blast of low-frequency sonic energy on impact. The weapon gains the deafen critical hit effect (see page 182). If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the deafen effect. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, or sonic damage can benefit from a _deafening_ fusion.
