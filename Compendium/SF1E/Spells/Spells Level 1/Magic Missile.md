## Description

You fire two missiles of magical energy that strike targets unerringly (the creatures must still be valid targets) and deal 1d4+1 damage each. You canâ€™t target specific parts of a creature, and objects are not damaged by the spell.

You can target a single creature or several creatures, but each missile can strike only one creature. You must designate targets before you attempt to overcome spell resistance or roll damage.

You can cast this spell as a full action. If you do, you fire three missiles instead of two.
