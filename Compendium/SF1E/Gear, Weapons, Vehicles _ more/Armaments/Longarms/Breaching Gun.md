# BREACHING GUN
A breaching gun uses scattergun shells as ammunition against a single target at short range, dealing an impressive amount of damage and even tearing through doors and other objects. These weapons are most commonly seen in the hands of space pirates who need to blast through plastic interior doors, though expert users can use these weapons to break through airlock doors. Breaching guns also saw widespread use on Absalom Station in the aftermath of the Gap, as security forces desperately tried to maintain control over the stationâ€™s fractured and panicked population, which often required blasting through barricades and sealed interior airlocks. Utility, snub, impact, vortex, and grapeshot breaching guns are widely available on various worlds.

### PROJECTILE WEAPONS

Projectile weapons fire solid rounds, such as bullets or rockets. While projectile weapons are relatively antiquated, they provide serviceable firepower at a reasonable price to many travelers and traders.
