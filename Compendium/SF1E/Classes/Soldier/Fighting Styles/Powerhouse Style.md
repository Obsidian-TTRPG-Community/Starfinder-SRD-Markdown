# POWERHOUSE STYLE
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 32_  
You specialize in getting the most out of unwieldy weapons, swinging the likes of doshkos and swoop hammers with unstoppable force. After all, you only need to hit your opponent once, as long as you hit them hard enough.

## UNWIELDY CLEAVE (EX) - 1ST LEVEL

You gain the Cleave feat even if you wouldn’t normally meet its requirements, and you can use Cleave with an unwieldy melee weapon, which isn’t normally possible. If you already have this feat, choose a bonus combat feat for which you qualify instead.  

## WEAPON BLOCKING (EX) - 5TH LEVEL

As a move action, you can grant an unwieldy melee weapon you wield the block weapon special property until the beginning of your next turn. If you use an unwieldy melee weapon with the block special ability to critically hit a target, the block property’s enhancement bonus to AC increases to +2 until the beginning of your next turn.  

## UNWIELDY OPPORTUNIST (EX) - 9TH LEVEL

When a creature provokes an attack of opportunity from you, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make the attack of opportunity with an unwieldy melee weapon you’re wielding, even if you’ve already attacked with it this round. If you have the soldier’s onslaught class ability or a similar ability that allows you to attack three or more times with full attack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use an unwieldy melee weapon you’re wielding to perform the full attack; when you do so, you perform one less attack than normal (e.g. making two attacks at a –6 penalty when using soldier’s onslaught). Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.  

## FORCEFUL ATTACK (EX) - 13TH LEVEL

As a full action, you can make one attack with an unwieldy melee weapon. If you hit, in addition to dealing damage, you can also perform a bull rush combat maneuver against the target, using your attack roll’s result as your combat maneuver’s attack roll to determine how far you push the target.  

## UNWIELDY POWER (EX) - 17TH LEVEL

You bring an unbelievable amount of strength to your attacks, striking down your opponents with ease. When you use an unwieldy melee weapon, your damage from weapon specialization increases to 1-1/2 times your character level.
