Pirates and adventurers use these heavily modified assault enercopters to ambush foes, escape with loot, and hide their plunder from prying sensors. The sides swing open to allow for quick assaults and retreats by their passengers. Occasionally, special operations teams will use these vehicles for false flag attacks.
