# Radcannon

Radcannons are large, dangerous-to-wield weapons typically employed by desperate, reckless, or unliving users. A radcannon’s high-voltage capacitors channel energy through a magnetron and transformer to generate massive blasts of radioactive waves, burning targets and typically exposing the target—and potentially the user—to dangerous levels of radiation. Devourer cultists often employ electromagnetic radcannons, neutron radcannons, and even rapid-decay radcannons, unfazed by the weapons’ danger.

### Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
