## DESCRIPTION

You convert your pain and emotional distress into a sharp, forceful reverberation that fractures another creature’s body. The target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the damage dealt by the spell and negate any additional effects.  
When you take damage from a spell or attack, you can cast this spell as a reaction, but only to target the creature that performed the triggering spell or attack. If the triggering effect was a critical hit or reduced your Hit Points to 10 or fewer (but not 0), you roll d8s instead of d6s to calculate your destructive rebuke’s damage. Casting this spell as a reaction doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.  
**1st:** When you cast destructive rebuke as a 1st-level spell, it deals 1d6 damage with the force descriptor, and the target is flat-footed until the end of your next turn.  
**2nd:** When you cast destructive rebuke as a 2nd-level spell, it deals 2d6 damage with the force descriptor, and the target is flat-footed until the end of your next turn.  
**3rd:** When you cast destructive rebuke as a 3rd-level spell, it deals 4d6 damage with the force descriptor, and the target is flat-footed until the end of your next turn.  
**4th:** When you cast destructive rebuke as a 4th-level spell, it deals 6d6 damage with the force descriptor, and the target is sickened for 1 round.  
**5th:** When you cast destructive rebuke as a 5th-level spell, it deals 9d6 damage with the force descriptor, and the target is sickened and flat‑footed for 1 round.  
**6th:** When you cast destructive rebuke as a 6th-level spell, it deals 13d6 damage with the force descriptor, and the target is knocked prone and becomes sickened and flat-footed for 1 round.
