# Carbonic Respiration Graft

As plantlike creatures, khizars have different respiratory functions than oxygen-breathing creatures. A complete overhaul of your own respiratory organs enables you to breathe in carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen. (Most atmospheres considered hospitable to life have an abundant supply of both.) In situations of slow suffocation, you reduce the number of effective creatures consuming oxygen by two, unless no oxygen-breathing creatures are present.
