A many-miened shield functions as a knight’s shield that deals bludgeoning damage when used to make unarmed strikes. A many-miened shield can accommodate five total armor upgrades; however, only two of the upgrades can be active at any time. As a move action (or as part of the move action used to align the shield against an opponent), you can deactivate either of the two active armor upgrades and simultaneously activate one of the shield’s inactive armor upgrades.
