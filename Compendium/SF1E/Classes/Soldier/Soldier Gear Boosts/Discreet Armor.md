You can attempt to conceal the fact you are wearing armor by removing the bulkiest pieces and dressing carefully. Doing so takes 10 minutes of work for light armor and 1d3×10 minutes of work for heavy armor and reduces the Armor Class bonus by 1 for light armor or 3 for heavy armor (to a minimum of +0). You can’t conceal power armor in this way. Then, roll a Disguise check (with a –4 penalty if you are concealing heavy armor). This sets the DC of the Perception checks of anyone observing you to notice you are wearing armor. If you are physically searched, the searcher gains a +4 bonus to the check. It takes the same amount of time to return your armor to normal.
