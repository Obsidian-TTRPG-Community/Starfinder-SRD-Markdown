# Stellar Cannon

A stellar cannon is a portable, handheld cannon that fires exploding shells filled with dense flechettes that shred nearby targets. Stellar cannons have a limited range, but they deal traumatic damage to large areas.

### Projectile Weapons

Projectile weapons fire solid rounds, such as bullets or rockets. While projectile weapons are relatively antiquated, they provide serviceable firepower at a reasonable price to many travelers and traders.
