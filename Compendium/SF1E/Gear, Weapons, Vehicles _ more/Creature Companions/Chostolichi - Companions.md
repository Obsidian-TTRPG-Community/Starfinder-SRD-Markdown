# CHOSTOLICHI - COMPANIONS
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 95_  
Reanimated from several smaller bodies and fused into a vaguely saurian shape, chostolichi servitors develop a pack mentality that desperately seeks a leader.

## CHOSTOLICHILEVELS 4-20

Large undead  
**Senses** darkvision 60 ft.  
**Good Save** Will; **Poor Saves** Fort, Ref

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Crumbling Embrace (Ex)** When reduced to 0 Hit Points by a melee attack, a chostolichi entangles the attacker until the end of the attacker’s next turn unless it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the chostolichi’s level).  
**Draining Bite (Su)** Once per hour when it damages a living significant enemy with its bite attack, a chostolichi can absorb part of the target’s vital essence, restoring a number of Hit Points equal to one-tenth the chostolichi’s maximum HP.
