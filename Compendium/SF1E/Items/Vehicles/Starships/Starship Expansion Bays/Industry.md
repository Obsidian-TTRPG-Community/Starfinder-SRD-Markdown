As functioning factories or industrial centers, some starships allow a specific Profession skill to be used to make money during voyages (or, at a GMâ€™s discretion, a set of linked Professions), though money earned is not collected until the starship makes port at a major settlement. For example, mining starships often feature a refinery, since miners can efficiently purify the metals or other mined substances onboard before transporting the refined product. Starships with industry bays can go directly to a construction or market area on another planet to sell goods without needing to return to a home planet first.
