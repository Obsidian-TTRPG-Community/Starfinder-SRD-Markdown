# HANDCOIL
An ultraminiaturized version of the coilguns used on starships, this weapon has a short range but a powerful effect. Some of the first versions were produced by starship manufacturers and were accompanied by a promotional campaign suggesting that a starship’s crew should match the starship itself, complete with flight suits to match a given ship’s paint job. Most manufacturers still use the model classification set forth in those early campaigns: explorer, fighter, pilot, and capital handcoils.

### SHOCK WEAPONS

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
