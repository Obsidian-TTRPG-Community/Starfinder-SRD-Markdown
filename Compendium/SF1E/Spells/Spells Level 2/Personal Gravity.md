# PERSONAL GRAVITY

**Source** _Near Space pg. 156_  
**Classes** Technomancer 2, Witchwarper 2  
**School** transmutation  
**Casting Time** 1 standard action  
**Range** personal  
**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)  

## DESCRIPTION

You alter gravityâ€™s effects on you. You treat gravity as if it were your choice of 1 step higher or lower (for example, if you were in an area of low gravity, you could choose either standard gravity or zero-g). You can suppress or resume this affect as a reaction or swift action. While under the effects of this spell, you can also reduce the distance of any forced movement that would affect you by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet), and you ignore penalties from the off-kilter condition.
