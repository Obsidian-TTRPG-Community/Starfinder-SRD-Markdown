Some believe the way vesk optimize their armor is the result of cultural training, while others say it has something to do with their scales. Either way, microfibers woven throughout your skin mimic this racial trait. When wearing armor, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to AC. When you are wearing heavy armor, decrease your armor check penalty by 1.
