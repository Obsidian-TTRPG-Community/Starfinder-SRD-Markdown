### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Snow Stride (Ex)** A wolliped treats heavy snow as difficult terrain, and snow as normal terrain.

**Spit (Ex, 9th level)** Once per hour as a standard action, a wolliped can regurgitate, spitting this vomit as a ranged attack (targeting EAC) at a target within 10 feet. On a hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half the wolliped’s level + the wolliped’s Strength modifier) or be sickened for 1d4 rounds.

**Warming Presence (Ex)** While mounted on or adjacent to your wolliped companion, you treat severe cold as cold and extreme cold as severe cold.
