A temple is a space dedicated to worship and meditation. Most temples are dedicated to specific deities, though it isnâ€™t unheard of to find temples dedicated to general connections, multi- or non-denominational worship, or simple meditation.  
During downtime, a mystic or other faithful can use a temple for the entertain downtime activity (Character Operations Manual152) for other willing participants and substitute a Mysticism skill check for the normal Profession skill check. A temple also grants a +1 circumstance bonus to Mysticism checks made as part of the channel divinity downtime activity (page 24).
