# AZLANTI EMPIRE SHIPS
In addition to the Klokworx Prism, a scout ship described inside the cover of _Starfinder Adventure Path, the following starships are manufactured within the Azlanti Star Empire. Vessels that have the Sovereign designation are built in the Imperial Foundry, which are the state shipyards for the empire. Government contractors and privately held companies construct many other sorts of vessels for the empire and its people. One prominent contractor is Klokworx Industries, which specializes in drones, drone deployment, and scout craft such as the Prism. Arioch-Oyadae, a tech conglomerate owned by allied noble families, has a subsidiary called Vanguard Craftworks that has long produced transport ships for the private sector and state interests. Imperial decree requires contractor tech to be safeguarded in the same way state-owned vessels are. Ships that might be deployed outside the empire, especially Klokworx drones and scouts, are fitted with self-destruct or autodestruct systems. Vessels that have crew have biometric locks to hinder intruders.
