# LIMITED TELEPATHY GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 145_  
**Item Level** 3; **Price** 1,500; **System** Brain  
Many creatures, such as lashuntas, shirrens, and entu colonies and symbiotes (page 34), are capable of partial telepathic contact with other creatures, and this augmentation mimics that racial trait. You can telepathically communicate with any creature within 30 feet with whom you share a language. Conversing telepathically with multiple creatures simultaneously is just as difficult as listening to multiple people speak at the same time.
