# Low-light Vision (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive pg. 155_  
The creature can see in dim light as if it were normal light. Low-light vision is color vision, unlike darkvision. A creature with low-light vision can read as long as even the tiniest source of light is next to it. Creatures with low-light vision can see outdoors on a moonlit night as well as they can during the day, since the moon casts dim light.

_Format_: **Senses** low-light vision.
