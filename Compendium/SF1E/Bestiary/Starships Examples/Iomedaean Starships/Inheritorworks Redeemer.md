## Description

If the Cathedralship (Pact Worlds 159) is the heart of the Iomedaean navy, the Redeemer is unquestionably its fist. Slow but indefatigable, these titanic vessels patrol the galaxy with authority. To date, only three of these powerful dreadnoughts have been completed. This is partly due to the vessels’ more specialized role—each operates independently from Iomedae’s 11 fleets—but primarily due to the immense cost. In battle, a Redeemer commonly serves as long-range artillery, blasting away from the back lines and relying on auxiliary starships to prevent foes from engaging its relatively under-protected aft quarter.  
  
Easily the most controversial addition to the Redeemer is its nuclear armament. Iomedaean starships employ nuclear weapons only sparingly—even against hated rivals—due to their potential for collateral damage and to old prejudices against weaponized toxins, including radiation. However, the Iomedaean navy ultimately equipped the Redeemer with a vast array of warheads, insistent that their forces not trail in firepower.  
  
In 311 ag, Inheritorworks launched its first Redeemer-class warship—the aptly named Redemption. Three months later, it engaged a Hellknight marauding fleet led by the less formidable cruiser Eye of Cocytus in Near Space. Even with its superior firepower, the Redemption succumbed to the Hellknights and was damaged beyond repair. Yet recovered starship logs indicate the battle involved no nuclear missiles, leading some to believe the commander hesitated to deploy the starships’ most powerful weapons.  
  
The abrupt loss shook the Iomedaean navy. Production stalled on future Redeemer-class warships until 314 ag, when Inheritorworks launched two new Redeemers: the Covenant and the Daybringer. Boasting enhanced armor and shields, these sister ships have wasted no time bringing the sword of Iomedae to the galaxy.
