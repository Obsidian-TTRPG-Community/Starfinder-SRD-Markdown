### Description

A fireburst chamber is a weapon accessory that attaches to a firearm’s barrel, and you can load it with a single grenade as a full action. You can fire the airburst tube as a ranged attack to detonate the loaded grenade, changing the area of its explode property to a 15-foot cone originating from your square. If this accessory is attached to a small arm, the grenade’s Reflex save DC is reduced by 2.
