## DESCRIPTION

Frequently used by formian taskmasters to assist with training workers in new fields or avoiding costly mistakes, this spell has become popular among educators, managers, parents, and mentors of all kinds. You establish a minor but long-range mental link with the target and are alerted whenever the target fails a skill check. Once during the spell's duration, you can nudge the universe into undoing the target's mistakes and allowing the target a second chance. As a reaction when the target fails a skill check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to allow the target to reroll the failed skill check with a +2 circumstance bonus. After the target rerolls a skill check, this spell ends. If you and the target are ever more than 10 miles apart, this spell ends.
