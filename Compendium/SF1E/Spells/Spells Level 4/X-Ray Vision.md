## DESCRIPTION

You confer upon the target sense through (vision) with a range of 60 feet. This ability is blocked by materials one-fifth as dense as those that block normal sense through (2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal), and it limits the target to black-and-white vision while in use. The target doesn't gain the benefit of any other special visual senses (such as lowlight vision) while using x-ray vision, and the target can't attempt sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet.
