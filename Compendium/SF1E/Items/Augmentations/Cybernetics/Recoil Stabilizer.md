# Recoil Stabilizer

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 89_  
**Item Level** 8;
**Price**::  8,550; **System** Arm and hand  
This prosthesis functions as a standard prosthetic arm but also boasts gas-venting systems and internal gyroscopes that provide you additional stability when firing large weapons. When you use the automatic weapon special property of a ranged weapon wielded in the augmented hand, you can activate the arm’s stabilizers (this requires no action), allowing you to score critical hits while making attacks in automatic mode. Roll damage separately against targets you score critical hits against. Once you have used the recoil stabilizer, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.
