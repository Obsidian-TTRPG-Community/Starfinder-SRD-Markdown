# DEVOURER’S Skin

Despite its name, this carbon-plate armor is the brainchild of overeager marketers at Brortrav Ordnance Factories, not nihilistic cultists. While the environmental protection system of Devourer’s skin is active, nanites hidden within its plates roil out and coalesce into dozens of short tendrils across the wearer’s body. While the nanites are active, the first time each round that a creature touches the wearer, that creature must succeed at a Reflex save (DC = 10 + the Devourer’s skin item level) or take acid damage equal to the armor’s item level. Furthermore, when the wearer makes unarmed attacks with the nanites active, they can choose to replace half of the damage dealt by their unarmed strikes with acid damage. This never causes an unarmed strike that targets KAC to target EAC instead. Wounds inflicted by Devourer’s skin have a characteristic “chewed” look that earned the armor its gory classifications.
