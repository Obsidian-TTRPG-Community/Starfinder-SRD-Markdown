## DESCRIPTION

This enormous carrier operates with a relatively few but highly specialized and talented personnel, and it can offer safe harbor to more vulnerable ships.

### MODULAR HARBOR A SZANDITE COLLECTIVE SHIP ADJACENT TO THIS SHIP CAN LINK WITH IT IN A SPECIFIC ARC. THE LINKED SHIP CAN’T MOVE OR FIRE ITS WEAPONS, AND DAMAGE THAT WOULD BE DEALT TO THE LINKED SHIP IS DEALT TO THE METROPOLIS’S SHIELDS IN THAT QUADRANT FIRST.
