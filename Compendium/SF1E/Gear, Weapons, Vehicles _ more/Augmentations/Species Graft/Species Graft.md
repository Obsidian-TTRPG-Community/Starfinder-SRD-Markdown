This section introduces a new type of augmentation known as a species graft, giving you the ability to partially transcend your species by taking on the racial traits of other species. Species grafts follow the rules for [[Augmentations|augmentations]], in that they are installed in specific systems on your body. Once installed, they become a part of your body and generally can't be affected by abilities that destroy or disable objects. Most of these [[Augmentations|augmentations]] are installed into the more common systems.  
  
Species grafts can be [[Cybernetics]], [[Biotech]], [[Magitech]] , [[Nanite]] enhancements, or any other form of augmentation. A specific species graft might describe its form, but that is merely an example. Your GM might decide what a species graft looks like when you purchase one or you might determine its specifics when you craft it. This doesn't affect how a species graft functions—only its appearance.  
  
The benefits of a species graft don't stack with the benefits granted by a racial trait of the same name. For example, a [[Vesk]] character can't benefit from the [[Armor Savant Graft]]. Species grafts are different from other [[Augmentations Manufacturers|augmentations]] in that they count as the racial trait mentioned in the name of the graft, and having one installed allows you to take [[Feats]] and other player options that have that racial trait as a prerequisite. For example, if you have a [[Limited Telepathy Graft]] installed, you count as having the limited [[Telepathy|Telepathy]]  racial trait in order to satisfy the prerequisite for the [[Extended Telepathy]] feat. You can't replace racial traits granted by species grafts with alternate racial traits, as those must be chosen at 1st level.  
  
If you have a species graft removed, you no longer count as having the associated racial trait. If you have [[Feats]]  or other options with that racial trait as a prerequisite, you can no longer use them. You can replace a feat with a new one that has no prerequisites by spending a full week retraining.
