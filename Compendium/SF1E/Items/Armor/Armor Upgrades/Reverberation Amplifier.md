Adding specially modified arabuk antlers to your armor allows you to harness their amplifying properties for your own sonic attacks. The armor upgrade makes a soft clicking sound reminiscent of an arabuk’s hunting clicks. This sound and the antler’s amplifying properties impose a –8 penalty on your Stealth checks while wearing this armor. When you use a weapon to deal sonic damage to a single target, you deal additional damage equal to half the weapon’s item level. In addition, once per day as a reaction when you would take sonic damage, you can overcharge the amplifier to reduce that damage by half.
