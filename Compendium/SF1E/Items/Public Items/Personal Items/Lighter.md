### Description

A lighter is a small canister containing a pressurized flammable liquid gas. When the lighter is activated, an electric arc ignites the gas, creating a tiny flame. You can light a small flame (such as a candle) as a swift action. Lighting a full fire is at least a full action or more, depending on the size and fuel of the fire.
