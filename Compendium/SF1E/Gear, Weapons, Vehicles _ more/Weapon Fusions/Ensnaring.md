Effect: The _ensnaring_ fusion binds the target on a critical hit. On a critical hit with this weapon, you can apply the entangle weapon special property. The entangle effect ends after 1 minute if the target has not already escaped it. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the entangle effect. If you successfully affect a target with both the _entangling_ and _ensnaring_ fusions on the same attack roll, only the _ensnaring_ fusion applies, and your use of the _entangling_ fusion is not consumed. Only weapons that deal bludgeoning, cold, piercing, or slashing damage can benefit from this fusion.
