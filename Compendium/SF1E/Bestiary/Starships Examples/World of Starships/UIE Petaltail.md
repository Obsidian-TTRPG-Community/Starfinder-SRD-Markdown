## Description

The Petaltail is one of the most popular models available from United Interfaith Engineering, as well as one of the most affordable. The small, one-passenger starship is popular among shirrens for independent excursions through the galaxy. It features medium-range sensors and comfortable quarters, but its real appeal for many is the customization factor of the exterior. The model is somewhat insectile in appearance (as is common for shirren starships) and decorated with thousands of “scales” in hundreds of different colors. No two are ever exactly alike. Every owner can choose a model that is unique, allowing shirren customers in particular to express their individuality. The ships are minimally defended, and it’s not advisable to take a Petaltail on particularly dangerous voyages
they’re primarily intended for exploration and pleasure trips.  
 
Petaltail starships aren’t particularly fast, but they are extremely maneuverable, making them popular with starship collectors of many species who want to show off trick piloting in a flashy vehicle. Many shirren celebrities are known for buying several or even dozens of Petaltails so they can choose a different one for each excursion. UIE even offers scale replacement for owners who find themselves getting bored with their loadout. Owners have also developed an entire subculture around modding Petaltails: adding extravagant wings, tails, and other adornments—color-coordinated with each individual ship, of course. UIE promotes this type of modification, selling supplies and even sponsoring contests for the best modification jobs. These contests usually involve parades and demonstrations of trick piloting, and many shirrens attend, even those who aren’t starship enthusiasts. Winning entries often get snatched up by collectors for huge sums of credits, and young shirrens sometimes hope to fund their own expeditions by upgrading Petaltails and competing in these contests.  
 
Often, Petaltail pilots travel together for safety when covering long distances. Known as clusters, these groups of dozens of Petaltails flying together are a common and colorful sight in the Pact Worlds. Most major port cities have a club where Petaltail pilots can convene, looking for others going to the same destination, with wealthy owners sometimes tagging along with these groups for fun, regardless of their destination. While the majority of clusters consist of peaceful travelers, occasional clusters of young and aggressive shirrens use their large numbers to gang up on other ships, stealing their cargo or just being nuisances. UIE decries the practice, and the Free Captains have started to take notice, especially when these raids occur in the Diaspora.
