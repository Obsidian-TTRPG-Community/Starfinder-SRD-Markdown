### DESCRIPTION

This handheld device can be attached to a datapad or computer to automatically scribe to text any clear audio source, such as a dictated message or a conversation at the next table in a quiet cafe. The text is automatically scribed in real time as the written form of the language spoken. To get an accurate transcription, a speech encoder must be within 10 feet of the speaker (in a quiet area) or spoken into directly (in a noisy area). Speech encoders are popular with urog researchers contemplating a particular theory but have gained widespread popularity with workers who need to maintain clear communication in loud environments and users with audio-processing disorders.
