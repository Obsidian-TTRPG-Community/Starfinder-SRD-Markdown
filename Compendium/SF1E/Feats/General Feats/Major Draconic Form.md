Benefit: The polymorph spell-like ability granted by Minor Draconic Form now functions as a 3rd-level spell. At 11th level, the spell-like ability instead functions as a 4th-level spell. Each time the level of the spell-like ability increases, you create a new predetermined polymorph form that has the dragon type for this spell-like ability; this replaces any other predetermined form you’ve learned for the spell-like ability.
