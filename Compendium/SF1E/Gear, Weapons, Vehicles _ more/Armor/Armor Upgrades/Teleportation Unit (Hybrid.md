# TELEPORTATION UNIT (HYBRID)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 85_  
**Item Level** 13; **Price** 52,000  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Any; **Bulk** 1  
**Capacity** 2; **Usage** 1  
This upgrade combines an advanced, real-time locating system with a magical teleportation device. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. As a standard action, you can teleport (per _[[Dimension Door]]_), vanishing and reappearing in a burst of what looks like holographic pixels. A _teleportation unit’s_ charges replenish each day.
