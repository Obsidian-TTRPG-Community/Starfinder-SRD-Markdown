# THRUSTER HEELS
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 58_  
**Item Level** 3; **Price** 1,250; **System** Feet  
Powerful thrusters built into your feet provide you with a brief burst of locomotive force. If you activate your thruster heels while jumping, you gain a +30 enhancement bonus to your Athletics check to jump. If you activate your thruster heels while flying, you gain a +30-foot enhancement bonus to your fly speed until the end of your turn, to a maximum of twice your normal fly speed. If you activate your thruster heels while attempting a melee attack to perform a bull rush or reposition combat maneuver, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to the attack roll, and you can also use the thruster heels to gain a +2 enhancement bonus when attempting to escape a grapple with an Acrobatics check or melee attack. Thruster heels don’t provide any stabilization, steering, or sustained life, so they can’t be used on their own to fly or perform similar aerobatics.  
After you activate the thruster heels, you can’t use them again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge them immediately.
