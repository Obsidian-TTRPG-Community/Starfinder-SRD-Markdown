### Special Abilities

**Harpoon (Ex)** This sniper weapon has a range increment of 60 ft. and the sniper (1,000 ft.) special property. When declaring an attack, the pilot can deploy a cable between the vehicle and the target. On a successful attack that deals damage, the user affixes one end of the cable to the target and the other end to any square in or adjacent to the autobridger’s space. The cable can be destroyed, as titanium alloy cable line (Starfinder Core Rulebook 219). An autobridger holds 4,000 ft. of cable.  
**Bridgespinner (Ex)** A phentomite autobridger can move along cable lines of at least titanium alloy strength with its crawl speed. While crawling, it can spin a bridge between the cable and another surface within 100 feet. Within an hour, this bridge hardens enough for Huge or smaller land vehicles to cross it.

### Description

Contact and trade with the Pact Worlds has helped the phentomites of Orry develop ever-more advanced solutions to living on their shattered world, where floating continents constantly shift. Autobridgers fire cable harpoons between floating land masses and then travel along them, knitting a carbon-fiber bridge between the new cables for others to cross.
