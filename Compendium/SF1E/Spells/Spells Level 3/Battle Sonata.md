## Description

Employed to great effect by the pahtra defenders of independent Pulonis, this spell weaponizes music to devastate foes. You compose a deadly song that unleashes dissonant chords in a cone-shaped burst in front of you, dealing 8d6 sonic damage to all creatures and objects in the area. A creature who fails its Will save against your _battle sonata_ is also staggered for 1 round.
