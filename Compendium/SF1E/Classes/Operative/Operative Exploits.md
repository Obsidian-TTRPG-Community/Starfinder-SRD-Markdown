# OPERATIVE EXPLOITS

You learn your first operative exploit at 2nd level, and an additional exploit every 2 levels thereafter. Operative exploits require you to have a minimum operative level, and they are organized accordingly. Some require you to meet additional prerequisites, such as having other exploits.  

## 2ND LEVEL

You must be at least 2nd level to choose these exploits.  

###  ALIEN ARCHIVE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
Your vast experience makes identifying new creatures easier for you. Double your operative’s edge bonus to your skill checks when identifying a creature and its abilities. If you successfully identify a creature, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your skill check when you make a trick attack against that creature. ###  Armor Optimizer (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 150_  
You’ve learned to customize your armor. You can adjust armor to fit you without needing to attempt an Engineering check. This also allows you to add one upgrade slot to the armor, though any upgrade that uses that slot functions only when you wear the armor. Such upgrades are useless to anyone else.

### BEGUILING OUTSIDER (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
You rely on aspects of your culture or society that others might find unfamiliar to pique their interest and make a good impression. Double your operative’s edge bonus to Bluff and Diplomacy checks when interacting with a creature or creatures who are unfamiliar with your species or home world (at the GM’s discretion). When you encounter such creatures, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a special Bluff or Diplomacy check whose DC equals 10 + 1-1/2 × the highest CR of these creatures, plus 1 for each additional creature in the group (maximum +10 for a group of 11 or more creatures). If you succeed, the creatures’ starting attitude improves by one step for 1 hour. This improvement doesn’t stack with any caused by other effects; however, this exploit’s short duration might allow you to attempt longer-lasting adjustments, such as with Diplomacy checks to change attitude. 

### COLLABORATIVE SPECIALIST (EX)
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 28_  
Whenever you successfully aid an ally’s skill check using one of your specialization’s associated skills, you can give that ally a bonus to their skill check equal to your operative’s edge bonus rather than +2. 

###  COMBAT TRICK (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
You gain a bonus combat feat. You must meet all of that feat’s prerequisites. 

###  COMING THROUGH (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 29_  
You can attempt an Athletics check in place of Acrobatics check when attempting to tumble through an opponent’s space. You can choose to attempt to tumble through an opponent’s space as a full action instead of as a move action, in which case you can move up to half your speed and reduce the check DC by 5. 

###  CONCEALED WEAPONRY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
You are adept at concealing your weapons and other items. Double your operative’s edge bonus to Sleight of Hand checks when attempting to hide a small object on your body. Additionally, you can draw a hidden weapon as quickly as a non-hidden weapon. ###  Death Strike (Ex)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 82_  
As part of any attack you make, you can add the operative weapon special feature to your unarmed attacks. When you do this, it loses the archaic weapon special feature. When you do this, if you would normally add 1-1/2 times your character level to damage as a special form of specialization (such as from a racial trait such as a vesk’s natural weapons), you instead add only your character level to damage. This is true regardless of how many abilities or effects you have modifying your specialization that apply to your unarmed attacks. 

###  DRAMATIC DIVE (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 29_  
When a vehicle you’re in becomes broken, becomes wrecked, crashes, or takes collision damage, you can use a reaction to jump from the vehicle as though you had a running start. You halve any falling damage you might take from this jump. You can’t use this exploit if you’re currently benefiting from total cover inside a vehicle, and the GM might prohibit its use in other situations where you couldn’t feasibly reach and break free from a vehicle’s interior. 

###  EFFICIENT FORAGER (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
You can attempt Survival checks in place of Life Science checks to identify animal, plant, and vermin creatures. You can move at your full overland speed when using Survival to live off the land, and your successful check provides food and water for an additional number of creatures equal to your operative’s edge bonus. ###  Elite Saboteur (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
You can attempt an Engineering check to disable a device on a lock or trap in half the normal time. If this would reduce the duration to less than 1 round, you can disable the device as a standard action. 

###  EXPEDITIOUS AMP (EX)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 29_  
You are practiced at quickly utilizing spell ampoules in emergency situations. You can inject yourself or a willing creature with a spell ampoule as a move action and can inject an unconscious creature as a standard action. 

###  FEIGN DEATH (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 82_  
Whenever you take damage, you can attempt to feign death as a reaction. You immediately fall prone and attempt a Bluff check against each opponent that is aware of you. The DC for this check is equal to 10 + your opponent’s total Sense Motive skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. Any opponent that you succeed against believes that you are dead and acts accordingly unless it inspects your body as a standard action and succeeds at a Medicine, Perception, or Sense Motive check at the same DC to uncover your deception. Maintaining this ruse is a full action each turn. 

###  FIELD TREATMENT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
You can take 1 minute to tend your wounds and spend 1 Resolve Point to recover a number of Hit Points equal to three times your operative level. 

###  HOLOGRAPHIC CLONE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
You can create holographic duplicates or psychic projections of yourself that conceal your true location. Once per day as a standard action, you can create 1d4 images of yourself that last for 1 minute per operative level. This ability otherwise functions as _mirror image_. You can use this exploit an additional time per day at 6th level, and again at 10th level. 

###  INOCULATION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
You’ve trained to resist various chemical and biological weapons, toxins, and pathogens you come across in the course of your missions. You add your operative’s edge bonus to Fortitude saves against poison and disease. 

###  INVIGORATING STRIKE (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 29_  
Victory reinvigorates you. Once per round when one of your attacks defeats a significant enemy, you regain Stamina Points equal to 1d4 + your key ability score modifier. The number of Stamina Points you regain increases by 1d4 at 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter. ###  Jack of All Trades (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
You’ve learned how to handle any situation. You can use all skills untrained, and you double your operative’s edge bonus when using a skill in which you have no ranks. 

###  KICK IT UP (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 82_  
As a move action, or at the beginning of any action you take that allows you to move (even if you do not choose to use that action to move), you may attempt to kick an unattended, unsecured object of no more than 2 bulk that is on the ground in your square or an adjacent square up into your hands. You must attempt a DC 15 Acrobatics check, and on a success you are holding the object in one or more of your free hands. If you hold it with enough hands to allow you to wield it, you can choose to be wielding it.

### LIGHTNING RELOAD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
You treat all small arms that do not have the automatic weapon special property as having the quick reload weapon special property. 

###  NIGHTVISION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
You can see in the dark as if you had low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet.

### PISTOL WHIP (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
You can use a small arm to make a melee attack. Treat this as an attack using Improved Unarmed Strike (whether or not you have that feat), but the attack is not archaic, deals lethal damage, and has the operative weapon special property. If you have an ability that gives you a special version of Weapon Specialization that allows you to add 1-1/2 × your level to natural or unarmed attacks as damage (such as vesk natural weapons), you add your level to pistol whip unarmed strikes; otherwise you add half your level as normal for an operative weapon. When you make an unarmed attack, you must decide before making the attack roll whether you are making a normal unarmed attack or using pistol whip to attack with a small arm. 

###  POWERFUL FLIER (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 29_  
You can perform an Athletics check in place of any Acrobatics check to fly. When ascending, the second square that you move upward doesn’t cost you an additional 5 feet of movement. You must have a fly speed to learn this exploit. 

###  QUICK DISGUISE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
Once per day as a standard action, you can quickly change your appearance. This functions as _disguise self_ and lasts for 1 minute per operative level. You can use this exploit an additional time per day at 6th level, and again at 10th level. 

###  SECURE MIND (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder ##32: The Starstone Blockade pg. 52_  
You have trained in methods to resist telepathic intrusion. Once per day, you can cast mental silence as a spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level. You gain an additional use of this exploit at 6th level, and again at 10th level. 

###  SENSE MAGIC (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 29_  
You can use detect magic as a spell-like ability at will, treating your operative level as your caster level. This allows you to attempt Mysticism checks to identify magic items. ###  Shuriken Assassin (Ex)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 82_  
You gain the Special Weapon Proficiency feat with carbonedge shuriken (and no other model of shuriken) as a bonus feat. Additionally, you can add your Dexterity modifier rather than your Strength modifier to ranged attack rolls with carbonedge shuriken, and you make melee attack rolls with carbonedge shuriken as if they were basic melee operative weapons. You can use the trick attack class feature with a carbonedge shuriken. At 3rd level, you gain the Weapon Specialization feat with carbonedge shuriken (and no other model of shuriken) as a bonus feat. At 12th level, you deal an additional 1d4 damage with carbonedge shuriken and treat them as having the injection weapon special property. At 17th level, the additional damage dealt with carbonedge shuriken increases from 1d4 to 2d4. 

###  TRAP SPOTTER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
You double your operative’s edge bonus to Perception checks to notice traps. Additionally, you automatically receive a Perception check to notice a trap when you pass within 10 feet of it. 

###  UNCANNY MOBILITY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
When you make a trick attack, if you choose the target of your attack before you move, your movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity from that target. When you use your standard action to move, you can choose one creature; you don’t provoke attacks of opportunity from that creature for this movement. 

###  UNCANNY PILOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 95_  
When you attack while you’re driving a vehicle, you halve the vehicle’s penalty to your attack roll (to a minimum of no penalty if the vehicle normally imposes a –1 penalty). When you’re in a chase, you gain a +2 bonus to skill checks you attempt when taking the evade or trick pilot actions. 

###  WITHOUT A TRACE (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 82_  
When you attempt a skill check opposed by a foe’s Perception check, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to your skill check’s result. In addition, the DC to follow your tracks with the Survival skill increases by 4. 

###  XENOLINGUIST (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
Double your operative’s edge bonus to Culture checks made to decipher writing. You don’t risk entirely misconstruing the meaning of the text unless you fail the check by 15 or more. If your result exceeds the DC by 5 or more, you decipher the writing in half the usual time.

## 6TH LEVEL

You must be at least 6th level to choose these exploits.  

###  ALL-TERRAIN PILOT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
You’re adept at piloting terrestrial vehicles. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to skill checks to use tricks during a vehicle chase. Once per vehicle chase while you’re piloting a vehicle, you can perform the double maneuver action, taking a –2 penalty to each skill check rather than a –4 penalty (or no penalty if your vehicle’s full speed is at least 50 feet faster than the fastest enemy vehicle’s full speed). You must have the uncanny pilot exploit to learn this exploit.

###  BLEEDING SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
For your debilitating trick, you can afflict your target with an amount of bleed damage equal to your operative level. ###  Certainty (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to reroll one of your specialization’s associated skill checks (see page 243). ###  Daring Leap (Ex)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 29_  
When calculating the Athletics check DC to jump, treat the total distance you’re trying to jump as though it were reduced by an amount equal to half your land speed bonus granted by the quick movement operative ability. As long as your jump brings you in contact with a solid surface like a wall or large piece of debris, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to immediately jump again from that surface as part of the same move action as though you had a running start; only after resolving this second jump do you fall if not on a surface that can support you. 

###  DEBILITATING SNIPER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You can use trick attack with sniper weapons; this counts as aiming the weapon properly for the purposes of the sniper weapon special property. You do not add trick attack damage to your attack, but the target can still be made flat-footed, and you can use debilitating tricks. 

###  DISARMING ATTACK (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to disarm the target. Choose an item the target is holding that would be subject to a standard disarm combat maneuver. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or drop that item. If the target gains a bonus to its KAC against disarm combat maneuvers it adds this bonus to its saving throw, and if it is immune to the disarm combat maneuver it is immune to this operative exploit. Once you have used this ability to attempt to disarm a creature, that creature is immune to your disarming attack for 24 hours. 

###  DISRUPTING SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to hinder your opponent’s ability to cast spells and spell-like abilities. The target must succeed at a Will save or be unable to cast spells or spell-like abilities for 1 round. Once you’ve used this ability to attempt to hinder an opponent’s spellcasting, that creature is immune to your disrupting shot for 24 hours. You must have the deactivating shot and staggering shot exploits to choose this exploit. 

###  ENHANCED SENSES (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You can sense your surroundings without needing to see them. You gain blindsense with a range of 60 feet. You must have darkvision and low-light vision, or the nightvision exploit, to learn this exploit. 

###  EXPLORER’S LASH (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
You’re proficient with disintegration lashes (Armory 10), monowhips, plasma lashes, taclashes, and similar one-handed, whip-like advanced melee weapons (at the GM’s discretion). You gain weapon specialization in these weapons as if your class granted proficiency, and you can use trick attack with these weapons. You don’t add trick attack damage to your attack, but the target is still flatfooted, and you can use debilitating tricks. You can choose to deal lethal damage with such weapons if they normally deal nonlethal damage. 

###  FAST AIM (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
As long as you are not flat-footed, off-kilter, or off-target, when attacking with a sniper rifle you use the range increment value listed with the sniper special property. 

###  HAMPERING SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
For your debilitating trick, you can reduce your target’s speeds by half and prevent it from using the guarded step action until the beginning of your next turn. 

###  HIGH-GROUND SNIPER (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
You exploit elevation to deliver especially deadly attacks from afar. When performing a trick attack with a sniper weapon, and so long as you’re at least 20 feet above your target for every 100 feet between you and the target (minimum 20 feet), you gain a bonus to the attack’s damage equal to half your operative level. You must have the debilitating sniper exploit to learn this exploit. ###  Improved Quick Movement (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You can move even faster than other operatives. You gain double the benefits of your quick movement ability, up to a maximum additional increase of +20 feet. You must have quick movement to learn this exploit. ###  Interfering Shot (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
For your debilitating trick, you can prevent your target from using reactions (see page 244) until the end of your next turn. ###  Knee Shot (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to knock the target prone. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or fall prone. If the target gains a bonus to its KAC against trip combat maneuvers, it adds this bonus to its saving throw, and if it is immune to the trip combat maneuver it is immune to this operative exploit. Once you’ve used this ability to attempt to knock a target prone, that creature is immune to your knee shot for 24 hours. This exploit counts as staggering shot for the purpose of meeting the prerequisites of other operative exploits. 

###  MENTALIST'S BANE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
If you fail your Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect with a duration of 1 round or more, you can attempt another saving throw against the effect 1 round later at the same DC. You get only one extra chance to save per effect.

If you succeed at a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect, you can prevent the effect’s originator from knowing you succeeded. You gain basic knowledge of what the mental effect would have made you do or feel, and you can attempt a Bluff check to pretend you are under that effect. If the mental effect would provide a link between you and the originator (like the _dominate person_ spell), you can choose to allow the link without the control. 

###  OPERATIVE'S POUNCE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 150_  
As a standard action, you can make a charge without the normal penalty to attack rolls when attacking on a charge, provided that you use an operative melee weapon to make the attack at the end of the charge. If the attack hits, you can substitute a debilitating trick effect for the damage the attack would deal. ###  Professional Trick (Ex)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 29_  
Choose one Profession skill. Add that skill to the list of skills you can use to perform trick attacks. If your chosen Profession skill used for a trick attack matches the Profession skill listed for a weapon you wield that has the professional weapon special property (Armory 30), you can use that weapon to perform the trick attack. Unless the weapon either has the operative special weapon property or is also a small arm, you don’t add trick attack damage to your attack, but the target is still flat-footed, and you can use debilitating tricks. 

###  RICOCHET SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 151_  
When you hit an enemy with a trick attack using a ranged weapon that targets KAC, you can forgo the effects of your debilitating trick to instead ricochet the projectile to a second target. Make a ranged attack at –6 against the second target and deal normal damage (without trick attack benefits) if the attack hits. You must have line of effect and line of sight both from you to the second target, and from the first target to the second target. When determining your attack penalties from range against the second target, count the full distance from you to the first target, and then the second target. 

###  SETUP STRIKE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 29_  
Instead of making an attack as part of a trick attack, you can perform either covering fire or harrying fire. After resolving your covering fire or harrying fire, attempt the trick attack’s skill check as normal. If you succeed at the check, you provide an additional benefit. For covering fire, if the selected ally is hit by the target’s next attack before the end of your next turn, roll your trick attack damage and reduce the enemy’s damage dealt to your ally by that amount (minimum 0 damage). For harrying fire, if the next ally to attack the target hits, roll your trick attack damage and add it to the attack’s damage. Once an ally takes less damage from your covering fire benefit or a creature takes additional damage from your harrying fire benefit, they are immune to your setup strike’s additional benefit for 24 hours. 

###  SOFT MOVEMENT (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
As a full action, you can move up to twice your speed, ignoring difficult terrain. When moving in this way, any liquid or solid surface will support you, regardless of your weight. You can move across water, lava, or even the thinnest tree branches, and environmental circumstances such as the slipperiness of the area you’re moving through or the current wind speed do not adjust the DCs of any Acrobatics or Athletics checks you attempt during this movement. While moving this way, you do not take damage from surfaces or hazards that react to being touched while moving in this way, such as from lava, and you don’t trigger any traps that use a location-based trigger. This ability doesn’t allow you to move across gases or vacuums, nor does it allow you to move across walls or vertical surfaces (though you can do so if you have an ability that allows you to, such as spider climb). At the end of your turn, this ability ends, and you are subject to any consequence of your location. 

###  SPEED HACKER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You can disable mechanical devices with Engineering and computer systems with Computers in half the usual time. In the rare cases when disabling a system or device would normally be a full action, you can do it as a standard action, and if it would normally be a standard action, you can do it as a move action. 

###  SPELL SNIPER (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 29_  
You can magically imbue sniper weapons using your magical assassin feature (page 28). When you succeed at the associated Mysticism check to deal additional damage with an imbued sniper weapon, instead of rolling your additional damage dice, you deal 3 additional damage of the chosen type, plus 1 at 7th level and every 2 levels thereafter (maximum 10 additional damage at 19th level). ###  Springboard (Ex)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 29_  
Once per turn when you succeed at a skill check to tumble through an opponent’s space, you can push off of that creature to gain additional momentum at the cost of their balance. Until the beginning of your next turn, the creature takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls when making attacks of opportunity, and the skill check DC for other creatures to tumble around or through the creature’s space is reduced by 5 (Reflex negates). In addition, you gain a +10-foot circumstance bonus to all of your movement speeds until the end of your turn. 

###  STAGGERING SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to stagger your target. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be staggered until the beginning of your next turn. Once you’ve used this ability to attempt to stagger a creature, that creature is immune to your staggering shot for 24 hours. 

###  STALWART (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
If you succeed at a Fortitude save against an effect that normally requires multiples successful saves to cure (such as a disease or poison), that effect immediately ends and is cured with a single successful save. 

###  SURE-FOOTED (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You move at your full speed when moving over difficult terrain, and without penalty when using Acrobatics or Stealth at your full speed. 

###  UNCANNY SHOOTER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
Your ranged attacks with small arms do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

## 10TH LEVEL

You must be at least 10th level to choose these exploits.  

###  BLINDING SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 151_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to temporarily blind a target. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or gain the blinded condition for 1 round. Once you’ve used this ability to attempt to temporarily blind a creature, that creature is immune to your blinding shot for 24 hours. You must have the bleeding shot exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  CLOAKING FIELD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
You can bend light around yourself and muffle any minor sounds you make, allowing you to nearly vanish when not moving. Even when you move, you appear only as an outline with blurry features. This cloaking field doesn’t make you invisible, but it does make it easier to sneak around. Activating the cloaking field is a move action. While the cloaking field is active, you can use Stealth to hide, even while being directly observed and with no place to hide. Attacking doesn’t end the cloaking field, but it does end that particular attempt to hide. If you remain perfectly still for at least 1 round, you gain a +10 bonus to Stealth checks (which doesn’t stack with _invisibility_) until you move.

Your cloaking field lasts for up to 10 rounds before it becomes inactive. While inactive, the cloaking field recharges automatically at the rate of 1 round of cloaking per minute. 

###  DARING EXPLORER (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 22_  
When you fail an Acrobatics or Athletics check, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to either reroll the check and use the new result or add 5 to your result and use the new value to determine whether you succeed at the check. You can’t use this ability on trick attack attempts. Once you’ve used this ability, you can’t use it again until you’ve taken a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points. 

###  DEACTIVATING SHOT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 96_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to temporarily suppress one magic item or deactivate one weapon, piece of equipment, or armor upgrade worn or carried by the target. Roll 1d20 + your operative level; the DC is equal to 10 + the item level. If you succeed, you deactivate the device (or suppress the item’s magical properties) until the beginning of your next turn. The device’s owner can spend a move action and attempt an Engineering check (for technological devices) or a Mysticism check (for magic items) against your operative exploit DC to try to reactivate the device.

You can instead use this debilitating trick to temporarily deactivate a construct that has either the magical subtype (such as a golem) or the technological subtype (such as a robot). You don’t need to attempt a check, but the creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the debilitating effect. If it fails, it’s stunned until the beginning of your next turn. Once you’ve used this ability to attempt to deactivate a construct, that creature is immune to your deactivating shot for 24 hours. 

###  DISARMING COMMAND (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 29_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to scare your opponent into dropping whatever they’re holding. Attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a target within 30 feet of you. If you succeed, choose an item the target is holding that would be subject to a standard disarm combat maneuver. The target must succeed at a Will save or fumble that item. A fumbled item isn’t dropped, but the target can’t operate the item without spending a move action to restore its grip on the item, and until the target restores its grip, combat maneuvers made to disarm the fumbled item gain a +5 bonus. If the target fails its Will save by 5 or more, it instead drops the item as if you had disarmed it.  
This ability can instead impede a target using a weapon with the integrated weapon special property. Failing the Will save by any amount causes the target to believe your attack damaged the integrated weapon in some way, preventing them from using that weapon for 1d6 rounds. As a move action, the target can check the affected weapon to end this effect.  
Once you’ve used this ability against a creature, it becomes immune to your disarming command for 1 hour. 

###  ELUSIVE HACKER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
Your hacking skills make your code incredibly difficult for countermeasures to pin down. Whenever you would trigger a system’s countermeasure while hacking the system, there is a 50% chance that you manage to elude the countermeasure and it doesn’t trigger. You still haven’t disarmed the countermeasure, and it might trigger in the future. 

###  EVER VIGILANT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
You’ve been on enough solo missions to know that you can’t let your guard down, even while sleeping. You take no penalties to Perception checks for being asleep, though you still can’t succeed at purely visual Perception checks while asleep. You can always act on the surprise round, though if you choose to do so when you would otherwise be surprised, you use your initiative result or the initiative result of the first creature that would have surprised you – 1, whichever is lower. 

###  EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder ##32: The Starstone Blockade pg. 52_  
After failing a saving throw against a magical effect with a duration longer than 1 round, you can attempt a second saving throw the following round to shake off the effect. If you succeed on this second saving throw, you gain a +2 insight bonus to saves against magical effects produced by the creature whose effect you just saved against; this bonus lasts for 24 hours. 

###  EXTENDED DEBILITATION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 151_  
When you hit an enemy with a trick attack, you can forgo your trick attack damage to increase the duration of the debilitating trick effect by 1 round. If you have the double debilitation ability, the duration of both debilitating tricks increases. Debilitating tricks with no duration (such as bleeding shot or knee shot) are unaffected. 

###  FALSE FRIEND (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 29_  
As a reaction, when a creature targets you with a hostile action, you can implant a brief psychic suggestion that you are a loved one, ally, or other creature they’d be unwilling to attack. The creature attempts a Will save against this mind‑affecting compulsion effect. If they succeed, they are shaken for 1 round by the unsettling experience. If they fail, the creature flinches and misses with the triggering attack, and additional attacks they make against you until the beginning of their next turn take a –2 penalty. Once you’ve used this ability, you cannot do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points. 

###  FEARSOME PRESENCE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 29_  
After you finish moving as part of a trick attack (and before attempting your attack, if you haven’t done so already), you can perform a quick, intimidating display that makes any foe adjacent to you shaken until the beginning of your next turn (Will negates). This shaken condition is suppressed for a creature whenever it is no longer adjacent to you. Once you use this exploit, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. This is a fear effect. 

###  GHOST STEP (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
You can’t be tracked using the Survival skill, though magical methods of following your tracks or finding your location function normally. When you would activate a trap with a proximity trigger, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attempt a Stealth check whose DC equals the Perception DC to find the trap. If you succeed, you don’t trigger the trap for 1 round. The trap becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours afterward. This ability doesn’t prevent you from triggering the trap if you remain in the area, nor does it prevent other creatures from triggering the trap. You must have the without a trace exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  GLIMPSE THE TRUTH (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
By picking up on subtle clues and hidden traces in your immediate surroundings, you can see things as they really are. As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain the effects of _true seeing_ for 1 round with a range of 60 feet. 

###  HOLOGRAPHIC DISTRACTION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create a single holographic duplicate or psychic projection of yourself that moves away from you for 1 round per operative level. The double climbs walls, jumps across pits, or simply passes through obstacles, moving at twice your speed in one direction indicated by you when the ability is activated. Its course cannot be changed. Those who interact with the double can attempt a Will save to recognize that it is not real. You must have the holographic clone exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  IMPROVED EVASION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
When you fail a Reflex save against an effect that has a partial effect on a successful save, you take the partial effect instead of the full effect. You must have evasion to learn this exploit. 

###  IMPROVED UNCANNY MOBILITY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
When you use the trick attack action or take a standard action to move up to your speed, your movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. You still provoke attacks of opportunity normally when making ranged attacks or casting spells. You must have the uncanny mobility exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  INFECTIOUS CHARM (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 29_  
When you succeed at a Bluff check to lie, a Diplomacy check to change a creature’s attitude, or an Intimidate check to bully a creature, you can so deeply impact one of the affected creatures that it repeats your action against one of its allies as soon as it reasonably can, using your skill check modifier. If you lied, the creature conveys the lie sincerely. If you changed the creature’s attitude, that creature tries to change its ally’s attitude toward you. If you bullied the creature, it bullies its ally into helping perform the same task. If you spend 1 Resolve Point when using this exploit, the creature instead repeats the action against a number of allies that doesn’t exceed your key ability score modifier. Affected creatures want to repeat your action, but aren’t compelled to do so; if they encounter significant obstacles while seeking out allies, it might detour or even abandon the task. 

###  INTELLIGENCE NETWORK (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
You have access to a secret intelligence network that gets you snippets of information and rumors you can sometimes use to reveal secrets or weaknesses of your rivals. This may be a collection of operatives and spies you have infiltrated, a connection to a formal information broker you trade tidbits of knowledge with, or an assemblage of allies and informants you’ve carefully curated over your travels.  
You can make an inquiry to your intelligence network as long as you have access to an infosphere or communication device with at least system-wide range. This gives you the same information you would gain from casting the vision spell, except you make a special class level check (1d20 + your operative level) in place of a caster level check, it does not require a Resolve Point, and it takes 1d4 weeks for your network to get an answer to you. Your network can work on only one question at a time, and if you make a new request before a previous one is fulfilled, all time spend on the original question is lost, and you take a –1 penalty to your new class level check due to confusion and lack of focus among your network. 

###  LASH SNARE (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
When you perform a trick attack with a one-handed, whip-like melee weapon for your debilitating attack, you can attempt to reposition the target. The target must succeed at a Reflex save or be moved 5 feet to a different location within your weapon’s reach and within 5 feet of its original placement. You can’t move the target past an obstacle. You must have the explorer’s lash exploit to learn this exploit. ###  Master of Disguise (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
You can take on the appearances of other creatures and even specific individuals. This functions as the quick disguise exploit, but the duration increases to 10 minutes per operative level. Alternatively, for 1 minute per operative level, you can take on the appearance of a specific individual that you have seen before. If you have heard the individual talk and can speak her language, you can also modulate your speech to match hers. This disguise is so convincing that creatures familiar with the individual must succeed at a Will saving throw before they can attempt a Perception check to pierce the disguise. You must have the quick disguise exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  OPTICAL OPTIMIZATION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 151_  
If you succeed by 10 or more at the skill check to deal additional damage on a trick attack, you ignore cover or concealment (but not total cover or total concealment) for that attack. 

###  PSYCHOKINETIC SKILLS (SP)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
You can use _psychokinetic hand_ as a spell-like ability at will. You can affect objects weighing up to 10 pounds per operative level you have, or 1 bulk per operative level you have. Additionally, you can use this spell-like ability with the Sleight of Hand skill and to perform the disable device task of the Engineering and Mysticism skills. 

###  SIGNATURE STUNT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
Choose a starship stunt (once made, this choice can’t be changed). When you make a Piloting check to perform that stunt in starship combat, roll twice and take the better result. You can choose and apply this exploit’s benefits to an additional stunt at 14th level and again at 18th level. 

###  SPIDER CLIMBER (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
You can traverse surfaces—even perfectly smooth or vertical ones—with as little effort as a spider. You gain _spider climb_ as a constant spell-like ability. If your _spider climb_ spell is dispelled or dismissed, you can spend 5 minutes of uninterrupted concentration to reestablish it. You must have a climb speed to choose this exploit. 

###  STUNNING SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
For your debilitating trick, you can try to stun your target. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be stunned until the start of your next turn. Once you’ve used this ability to try to stun a creature, it’s immune to your stunning shot for 24 hours. You must have the staggering shot exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  TERRAIN CONCEALMENT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
When you perform a trick attack, you make exceptional use of nearby cover and concealment until the beginning of your next turn. If you have partial cover or cover and would be hit by an attack or fail a Reflex save, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to increase the cover’s bonus to your AC and Reflex saves by 2 against that effect; this ability can cause the attack to miss or cause your saving throw to succeed. If an attack would hit you while you have concealment, but the miss chance for concealment hasn’t yet been rolled, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to increase the miss chance for concealment by 10% (maximum 35% miss chance). If the triggering attack misses, you can immediately take a guarded step. 

###  TRICK STUNT (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 29_  
When you use a full action to perform the ram or run over vehicle actions, you can perform a Piloting check with a DC of 20 + your target’s CR (or the first target’s CR for the run over action). If you succeed, roll your trick attack damage and divide the result by 2. You add this amount to the collision damage your vehicle deals to the first target, and you subtract this amount from the damage dealt to your vehicle when colliding with the first target. If you succeed at the Piloting check by 5 or more, you can also apply your debilitating trick to the first target you damage with the action. 

###  UTILITY BELT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 151_  
You can spend credits to store supplies in your utility belt, effectively depositing credits for later use. The maximum amount is equal to 1,000 credits per operative level you have (2,000 credits per level at 13th level, and 5,000 credits per level at 17th level). As a move action, you can produce any item with light or negligible bulk from your utility belt that does not have a price that exceeds the amount of credits currently deposited in the belt and that has an item level no greater than your operative level –2. This reduces the number of credits stored in the belt by a value equal to the item’s price. Once you have spent the credits deposited in the belt, you must spend 1d4 hours buying supplies in a typical settlement before you can use the utility belt again. 

###  VERSATILE MOVEMENT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
You gain a climb speed and a swim speed equal to your land speed. This speed is not increased by the quick movement class feature or improved quick movement exploit.

## 14TH LEVEL

You must be at least 14th level to choose these exploits.  

### AUDACITY (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
You can take an unexpected or socially unacceptable action with such total confidence and lack of doubt that the target can’t immediately react to it. You can make an Intimidate check to demoralize a foe, but rather than cause them to be shaken on a successful check, you cause them to be staggered for 1 round plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC. Once you have used this ability against a specific target, you cannot target them with it again for 24 hours. 

###  DUAL SPECIALIZATION (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
Select an operative specialization other than your own. Once this choice has been made, it cannot be changed. You gain the 11th level ability granted by the specialization. You are not considered to have the second specialization you selected for purpose of any prerequisite.  
You must have Skill Focus in the associated skills of the selected specialization, and must have taken its specialization exploit as one of your normal operative exploits. 

###  EFFICIENT CLOAKING FIELD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
Your cloaking field lasts for up to 100 rounds (10 minutes), and it recharges at the rate of 2 rounds of cloaking per minute while inactive. You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to recharge 20 rounds immediately, and you can do this even while the cloaking field is active. You must have the cloaking field exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  EXTREME MOVEMENT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
Your climb speed and swim speed are increased by your quick movement class feature and the improved quick movement exploit. You must have the versatile movement exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  KNOCKOUT SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
For your debilitating trick, you can attempt to knock the target out in one blow. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. Once you’ve used this ability to attempt to knock a creature out, that creature is immune to your knockout shot for 24 hours. You must have the staggering shot and stunning shot exploits to learn this exploit. 

###  MULTIATTACK MASTERY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
When you use triple attack or quad attack to attack the same target with all of your attacks, after your full attack is complete, if at least two of your attacks hit, you can apply a debilitating trick to the target. 

###  SHADOW SLIDE (SP)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 83_  
Your mastery of stealth and understanding of the shadows of the Material Plane is so great, you can actually physically walk into the edges of the Plane of Shadow. You must expend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability. It functions as _shadow walk_, except you can only use it on yourself and items or creatures you can carry, the duration is no more than 1 hour, and you must emerge from the Plane of Shadow back into the plane from which you departed. 

###  SURVEILLANCE WRAITH (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 151_  
You are invisible to technological surveillance systems and most forms of divination magic, per _nondetection_.

### TELEPORT TRACE (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
As a reaction when you observe a creature casting a spell or using a supernatural ability with the teleportation descriptor (such as _dimension door_), you attempt a Survival check whose DC equals 10 + 1-1/2 the creature’s CR. If you succeed, you learn the creature’s destination. This knowledge is precise if the creature traveled to a location within 2,000 feet of you or traveled to a location that’s familiar to you. For a distant location you’ve never visited or studied, you sense the creature’s general coordinates, narrowing down its destination to a town or 5-mile-radius region, but not its exact location. 

###  UNCANNY SENSES (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 97_  
Your enhanced senses grow even more discerning. Your blindsense becomes blindsight with a range of 60 feet. If you have darkvision, its range increases by 30 feet. You must have the enhanced senses exploit to learn this exploit. 

###  VIRULENT SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 23_  
If you’re wielding a weapon that targets KAC, for your debilitating trick, you can apply a dose of injury poison to the ammunition or weapon used as part of making the trick attack. If you exceed the target’s KAC by 8 or more, the poison’s initial save DC increases by 2.
