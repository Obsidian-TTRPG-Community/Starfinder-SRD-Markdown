## Description

You expose targets to churning entropy which turns parts of their body sickly and black. Each target takes 2d6 damage. A successful Fortitude save halves this damage.  
You can focus on only one target rather than multiple. If you target only a single creature with this spell and it fails its save, the target is also staggered for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.
