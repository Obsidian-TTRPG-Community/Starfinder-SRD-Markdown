# Blazing Strike 
(Ex)
source: Starfinder Armory pg. 154
When you hit a creature within 30 feet of you while using a weapon with the bright weapon special property, the radiance partially blinds the target, giving it the dazzled condition for 1 round. If you hit multiple creatures at the same time 
(Such as with an automatic, blast, or explode weapon), only the creature nearest to you or at the center of the explosion (your choice if multiple creatures are equidistant) is affected.
