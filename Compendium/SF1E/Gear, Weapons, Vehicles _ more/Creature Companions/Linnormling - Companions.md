# LINNORMLING - COMPANIONS

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 82_  
Despite their size, linnormlings claim to be descendants of the Eldest Ragadahn. They’re willful creatures yet offer their expertise with curses to anyone offering them proper tribute.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Spiteful Curse (Su; 10th level)** When the linnormling takes damage from a creature’s spell or attack, they cast bestow curse on that creature as a reaction with a range of 30 feet without having to touch the target (Will negates DC = 10 + half the linnormling’s level + the linnormling’s Charisma modifier). The curse lasts until the end of that creature’s next turn. If the spell or attack reduced the linnormling to 0 Hit Points, the curse instead lasts a number of rounds equal to the linnormling’s Charisma modifier. Once they use this ability, they can’t do so again for 1d4 rounds.  
**Zap (Ex)** A linnormling has a ranged attack that deals electricity damage and has a range of 60 feet.
