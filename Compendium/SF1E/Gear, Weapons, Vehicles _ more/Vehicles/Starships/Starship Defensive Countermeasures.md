# STARSHIP DEFENSIVE COUNTERMEASURES
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 298_
Defensive countermeasures systems protect a ship from tracking weapons such as missiles, and they make it difficult for enemies using sensors to get a solid reading on the ship. They do this via a complicated suite of electronic sensors and broadcasting equipment that’s designed to jam enemy sensors and create false readings. These systems grant a bonus to a ship’s TL (see page 320); the bonus, PCU usage, and cost are listed in the table below.
