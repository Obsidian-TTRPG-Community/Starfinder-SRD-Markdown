Sci-shield units protect scientists conducting dangerous fieldwork. The suit excels at deflecting radiation (granting protection against radiation as if it were item level 7). A biohacker or mechanic wearing a sci-shield unit treats their class level as two higher than normal for the purpose of determining the range of their custom microlab and remote hacking class features.
