# REACTION ACCELERATOR (HYBRID)

**Item Level** 9; **Price** 13,500

This upgrade magically analyzes stress hormones in your bloodstream and, when you are in a threatening situation, stimulates your glands to release hormones that allow you to react quickly. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. When you roll initiative, after seeing the result of your initiative check, you can immediately spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll your initiative with an additional +4 bonus and take the better of your original result or your new result.
