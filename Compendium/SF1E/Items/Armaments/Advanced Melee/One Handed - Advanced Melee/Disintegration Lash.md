A disintegration lash is a marvel of bioengineering—a technological living organism that feeds on matter by breaking it down with its own high-energy proton-decoupling field. The result is a black, snakelike lash crackling with red-tinged energy, making this a weapon commonly wielded by those looking to intimidate their foes. Disintegration lashes are designated in the standard method for disintegrator weapons: liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator.

# Disintegrator Weapons

Available as pistols (small arms), rifles (longarms), and cannons (heavy weapons), these powerful weapons are often referred to by the more scientific term “high-energy proton decouplers,” as they produce streams of energized fields that corrode and break down matter much like subatomic acid would. However, since their effects appear to turn metal to slag, plastic to vapor, and flesh to goo, they’re commonly known as “disintegrators.” Devourer cultists particular revere disintegrators because the weapons slough away their enemies’ flesh.
