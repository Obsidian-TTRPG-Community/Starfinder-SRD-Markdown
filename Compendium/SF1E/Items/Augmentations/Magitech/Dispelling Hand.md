# Dispelling Hand

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 90_  
**Item Level** 9;
**Price**::  14,300; **System** Hand  
Holographic mystic sigils project from your hand when you activate this implant. Your hand must be free to do so. As a reaction, you can gain a +1 insight bonus to your AC against a spell that requires a successful attack roll. Alternatively, as a standard action, you can use _dispel magic_ as a spell-like ability with a caster level equal to your level, but it can’t counter spells and it can’t target anything other than you unless you touch the target. To affect an unwilling target, you must hit it with a melee attack against its EAC; you activate the augmentation as part of the attack roll, and you can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher. Once you use _dispel magic_ this way, you can’t use your _dispelling hand_ for either of its uses until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any time to recharge it immediately.
