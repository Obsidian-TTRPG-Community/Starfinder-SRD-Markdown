## Porter Drone

Level:: 4

This sturdy Medium drone is designed to haul loads and assist with laborious tasks. Most porter drones resemble stout humanoids with large treaded wheels at the ends of two thick legs and a smooth faceplate with two optical sensors as their only facial features. A porter drone acts as the combat drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the cargo rack and manipulator arms mods instead of the combat drone’s normal initial mods. Its skill unit is Perception. A porter drone has 20 bulk.
