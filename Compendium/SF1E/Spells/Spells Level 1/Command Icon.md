## Description

Hobgoblins created this spell to signify rallying points and provide commanders with better ability to organize troops. The target creature seems more imposing, granting the creature a +2 morale bonus to Charisma-based checks made to motivate troops and all Intimidate checks. A symbol of leadership, such as the seal of an organization or a deity's holy symbol, illuminates above the target. This symbol increases the light in a 10-foot radius by one step, up to normal. The light imposes a â€“20 penalty to Stealth checks and prevents the target from benefiting from concealment from darkness, invisibility, and similar effects. The target gains a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against fear and being charmed, as do allies while they remain within the symbol's light.
