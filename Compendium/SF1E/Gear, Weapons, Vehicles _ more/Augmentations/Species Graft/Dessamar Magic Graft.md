# DESSAMAR MAGIC GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 143_  
**Item Level** 7; **Price** 6,200; **System** All Hands  
Whether imago or instar, dessamars have intrinsic magical abilities. Technology-infused runes carved into your hands (or similar appendages) allow you to cast charm person once per day, as well as detect magic and telepathic message at will as spell-like abilities. The caster level for these effects is equal to your level.
