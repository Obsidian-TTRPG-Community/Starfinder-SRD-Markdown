TACTICS

**Before Combat** The detective has darkvision and life bubble active in her cache capacitor. If she’s expecting trouble, she’ll cast haste on herself and her allies, followed by flight and resistant armor.

**During Combat** The detective is a cautious combatant. She prefers to try to ambush if possible, using allies as a diversion and withdrawing and moving to a better vantage point to take out lone opponents one by one.

**Morale** Very cautious, the detective never allows herself (or allies, if she can help it) to fall below half hit points without calling for a retreat.
