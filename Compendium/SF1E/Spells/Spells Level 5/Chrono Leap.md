## Description

You rocket the target forward through time, sending them careening across the battlefield. You move the target up to 60 feet in a straight line. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. The target can attempt a Reflex saving throw to prevent this movement and negate the additional effect below.

At the end of this movement, the creature reenters the flow of time with a burst of temporal energy. Creatures adjacent to the target take 4d6 bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone. A creature in this area that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw takes only half damage and isn't knocked prone.
