These extra-thick armor plates don’t increase your defense in general, but add a little extra protection when you specifically try to defend yourself. When you have the cowering condition or take the total defense or withdraw action, you gain a +2 bonus to AC.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in heavy armor.
