When you score a critical hit with the weapon, if at least one target of the attack takes damage equal to at least 3 × the weapon’s item level, you recover a number of Stamina Points equal to the weapon’s item level, in addition to the critical hit’s other effects. After you benefit from this fusion, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.
