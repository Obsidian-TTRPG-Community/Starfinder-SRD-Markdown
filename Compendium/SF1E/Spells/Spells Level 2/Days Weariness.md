## Description

You launch an opponent's mind forward in time, forcing them to experience a day's events in a moment. The target takes 4d8 damage and becomes fatigued for the duration, or they become exhausted for the duration if already fatigued. The target can attempt a Will saving throw to halve the damage dealt by this spell and negate the fatigued condition.
