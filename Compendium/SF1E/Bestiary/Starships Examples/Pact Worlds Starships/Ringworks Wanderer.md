## Description

One of Ringworks’ most versatile designs, the Wanderer evolved out of early aerospace fighters and spaceplanes and still maintains much of their sleek design. Many organizations and governments use a slimmed-down and armed-up version of the Wanderer—sometimes called a Starwasp—for planetary defense or as a short-range fighter.
