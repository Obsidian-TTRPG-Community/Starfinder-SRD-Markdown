# XENOWARDEN STARSHIPS
A cross between conventional starship design and massive plant creatures, the ships of the Xenowardens are undeniably unique. Grown in orbital nurseries owned by the Xenowarden-sponsored Unified Conservatory (UC for short), these vessels are living things. The larger vessels also have a form of consciousness, although it is closer to animal empathy than actual sentience. Xenowarden crews and captains regularly take part in a deep bonding ritual with their starships.  
  
Technology is incorporated into Xenowarden vessels from the beginning, although they are fueled in ecologically conscious ways. These vessels draw on solar power to recharge their batteries, which use a specialized form of electrostatic algae to hold a charge. This has the unfortunate side effect of making their vessels extremely susceptible to radiation weapons, which can drain their power sources and leave the ships adrift and dead. One of the most common vessels in the order’s fleet is the Arkship. These vessels are formed of up to eight smaller Pod ships merged together. Most of them retain the ability to “shed” a few of their vessels to be used as shuttles when needed. This design also allows them to be very easily repaired. If one Pod is particularly damaged, it can be replaced with a brand-new, fully functional Pod in less than an hour.  
  
The largest Xenowarden vessels are the Gardenships, marvels of bioengineering that are capable of supporting their crews without any power at all as long as they receive enough solar radiation to sustain their hydroponic gardens. These vessels are still comparatively rare, and the Xenowardens view them more as ecological orbital platforms than conventional ships. Unfortunately, Gardenships take a long time to grow, and the bonding process can be grueling for some species.
