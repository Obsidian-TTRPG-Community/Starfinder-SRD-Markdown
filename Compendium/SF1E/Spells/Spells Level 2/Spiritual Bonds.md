## Description

Dwarves call on their ancestors to cast this spell of traditional sharing of burdens. This spell connects you and allies in the area on a spiritual level. Each target gains a +1 morale bonus to saving throws. You know when an affected ally is unconscious or dying, provided the creature is within 120 feet of you. Affected creatures can, as a standard action, spend Resolve Points on behalf of an affected ally within 30 feet to help that ally either stabilize or stay in the fight. Two different allies doing so can allow both to occur during the same round.
