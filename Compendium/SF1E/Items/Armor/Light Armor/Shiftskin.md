# Shiftskin

Developed by the reptoids for their agents, shiftskin comes in a variety of designs styled to resemble normal clothing, uniforms, and even other light armors. Each suit of shiftskin is designed to accommodate both its owner’s natural form and one other specific assumed form of another race, shifting and reshaping as needed when the reptoid changes shape. Thus a suit of shiftskin can be adjusted to accommodate two different forms, rather than fitting only one form at a time.

Shiftskin has been adapted for use by other races. Even when used by non-reptoids, an individual suit can still can be adapted to shift between two different forms, so long as those forms are no more than one size category apart. Though obviously of use for non-reptoid shapeshifters, this also allows the same suit to fit two different wearers.
