# Kasathan Battle Dance

**Source**:: _Pact Worlds pg. 191_  
You are a student of the battle dances of kasathan legends. You weave in and out of a fray with grace, moving your arms and body in a flowing motion that confounds your foes.

**Prerequisites**: Prerequisites: Dex 13, Mobility or trick attack.

**Benefit**: When you take the withdraw action and have at least two hands free, none of the squares you move through are considered threatened by any opponent whose location you are aware of (see The Four States of Awareness on page 261 of the _Starfinder Core Rulebook_).

**Normal**: When you withdraw, the square you start out in is not considered threatened by opponents you can see, but squares you subsequently move through may be.

**Special**: A solarian with a solar weapon treats the hand holding the solar weapon as being free for purposes of using this feat.
