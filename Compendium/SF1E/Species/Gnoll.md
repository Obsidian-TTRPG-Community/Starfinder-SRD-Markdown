[[Species_Gnoll.png|Zeigen!]]

Gnolls are hyena-headed humanoids with a reputation as bloodthirsty raiders, scavengers, and cannibals. They are capable hunters who respect power and strength over station or role, and most gnolls would believe their own survival takes precedence over any kind of morality.

## Natural Weapons

Gnolls can attack with a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn’t count as archaic, and threatens squares. Gnolls gain a special version of the Weapon Specialization feat with this unarmed strike at 3rd level, allowing them to add 1-1/2 × their character level TO their damage rolls for this unarmed strike (instead of just adding their character level, as usual).

## Self-sufficient

Gnolls gain a +2 racial bonus to Survival checks.
