# Sacred Strike (COMBAT)

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 118_  
You imbue your weapons with the essence of your deity to strike down opposing forces.

**Prerequisites**: Worship a deity of an alignment within one step of your own.

**Benefit**: When you make an attack as a standard action against a creature, your attack is treated as having the same alignment as the deity you worship for the purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

**Special**: If you change which deity you worship, this feat gives you no benefit until you next gain a character level, and then only if you still meet the prerequisite.
