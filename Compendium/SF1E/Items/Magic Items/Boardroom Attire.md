### Description

This elegant tailored suit resembles a platinum AbadarCorp travel suit and has the same statistics as that armor. In addition, sigils of divination woven into the fabric of the suit subtly alert you to lies. When wearing a suit of _boardroom attire_, roll twice when attempting Sense Motive checks to detect deception and use the higher result. In addition, you never think a truthful statement contains deceptions, even if you fail your check by 5 or more.
