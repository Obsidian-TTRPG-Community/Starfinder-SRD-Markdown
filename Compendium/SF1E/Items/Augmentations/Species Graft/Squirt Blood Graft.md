# Squirt Blood Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 147_  
**Item Level** 2;
**Price**::  700; **System** Eye  
Ikeshtis have developed a unique deterrent and a small sac installed behind one of your eyes affords you a similar ability. As a move action, you can squirt blood from your eye at a foe within 30 feet. Make a ranged attack against the target’s KAC. A successful hit grants the next ally who attacks that foe the benefit of harrying fire. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every 5 character levels you have.
