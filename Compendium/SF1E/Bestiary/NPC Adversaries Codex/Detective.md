# Detective

Investigators uncover secrets and sift truth from lies. This often places investigators on the side of the law, but when the powers that be are corrupt, investigators might find themselves labeled vigilantes or ostracized. Yet they aren’t easily discouraged, and can become relentless foes.

**Pursue Suspect (Ex)** A detective can designate a target they can see and suspect has committed a crime as a suspect as a move action. A target remains a suspect until apprehended, proven innocent, or until the detective clears the target of suspicion as a full action. A detective can have a maximum number of suspects equal to their half their Wisdom modifier at one time. A detective gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and skill checks against their suspects.

## Description

Detectives pursue and apprehend those deemed criminals, leaving matters of judgment and incarceration to the courts to handle. They specialize in subduing their foes, often considering lethal tactics to be unprofessional or beyond their jurisdiction. Most detectives work within the law, but some work outside or even against it, particularly in areas where government authorities can’t be counted upon to uphold the law.
