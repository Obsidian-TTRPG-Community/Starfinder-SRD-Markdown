# STARSHIP MOVING
The pilot of a starship has a variety of [[Starship Actions]] (see page 324) that allow her to guide her starship through the cold vastness of space. Unlike in battles between characters, starships face a specific direction, and this determines their firing arcs and shield quadrants, as well as their direction of movement. 

# SPEED

A starship’s speed is the number of hexes it typically moves in a round. It can instead move fewer hexes than this amount, as determined by the pilot. This movement is in a straight line in the direction the starship is facing, though a starship’s facing can be altered while it moves by making turns (see below). A starship’s maximum speed modifies [[Piloting (Dex)]] checks for that starship.

| Speed      | [[Piloting (Dex)]] Check Modifier |
|------------|-------------------------|
| 4 or less  | 2                       |
| 6          | 1                       |
| 8–10       | —                       |
| 12         | –1                      |
| 14 or more | –2                      |

# TURNS

While moving, a starship can make turns, altering its forward movement direction, firing arcs, and shield quadrants. One turn changes a starship’s forward facing by 60 degrees, or one side of a hex. Every round in which a starship turns, it must move a certain number of hexes before each turn, determined by its maneuverability (see the table below). For example, a ship with average maneuverability making two turns in a round must move at least 2 hexes before its first turn, and at least 2 more hexes before its second turn. If a starship has perfect maneuverability (the distance between turns is 0), the ship can make two turns for each hex that it moves (allowing it to turn around a single point).  
  
The number of turns per round a starship can take is limited only by its speed and maneuverability. Turns don’t count against a starship’s movement speed. If a ship with average maneuverability has a speed of 8, it can usually turn a total of four times during a single round.  
  
A ship’s maneuverability also modifies [[Piloting (Dex)]] checks for it.

| Maneuverability | Distance Between Turns | [[Piloting (Dex)]] Check Modifier |
|-----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Clumsy          | 4                      | –2                      |
| Poor            | 3                      | –1                      |
| Average         | 2                      | 0                       |
| Good            | 1                      | 1                       |
