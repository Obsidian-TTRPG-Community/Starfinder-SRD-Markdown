### DESCRIPTION

Lashunta biologists genetically engineered the shrieking larva from a creature found in Castrovelâ€™s jungles. This living weapon is dormant until fed power through a manual trigger. A telepathic user can mentally trigger the larva to siphon energy as needed, causing the weapon to fire faster than by trigger. When powered, the stimulated larva shrieks. This simultaneously shrill and oscillating outburst forms a coherent beam emitted in the direction the larva is pointed.
