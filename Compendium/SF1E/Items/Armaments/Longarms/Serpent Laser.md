# Serpent Laser

The serpent laser is a creation of the Aspis Consortium, meant to undercut the pricing of its competitors while consuming battery charges at a higher rate to drive the sale of additional batteries, higher-capacity batteries, and recharging services. Experienced spacefarers know the scheme behind the serpent laser and generally avoid what they have come to call the “snakebite laser,” though amateurs and novices often fall for the low initial price. Serpent lasers have the same model names as many standard laser rifles (azimuth, corona, aphelion, and perihelion), though savvy customers know that the serpent laser models are often slightly less powerful than their conventional counterparts.

### Laser Weapons

Laser weapons emit highly focused beams of light that deal fire damage. These beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.

Laser weapons use various means to concentrate beams of light into deadly intensity. Some focus light through a faceted crystal, while others focus the beam through a chemical cloud or ionized gas.
