# Courier

Guides provide safe passage for a fee, shepherding travelers through dangerous or unfamiliar territory. Most specialize in a specific region, using their knowledge, connections, and adaptability to bring clients to their destination in one piece. Used to situations where they and their clients are on their own, guides tend to prefer finesse to force in tough situations, but if charm doesn’t work, they’ll do whatever it takes to get the job done.  
While the most straightforward way for players to encounter a guide is by hiring one, guides offer a variety of other potential encounters. Players might find a stowalong on their ship, retrace a captains club guide’s adventure, use a personal concierge to gain access to power, or help a courier track down a local rumor. Guides also often have valuable information about planetary conditions, know the location of unexplored sites, and can make connections with influential locals.

## Description

Couriers’ knowledge of an area comes from their work delivering goods throughout their city, planet, or system of choice. They make it their business to be friendly with their customers, who range from small businesses and long-distance lovers to underground criminal enterprises. Couriers get to know their delivery area well, gathering information on shortcuts, hotspots, and landmarks usually known only to locals. They fit in guide work between deliveries and usually pick up customers while on the job, learning to keep an eye out for those new to an area who might be willing to pay to get the lay of the land.
