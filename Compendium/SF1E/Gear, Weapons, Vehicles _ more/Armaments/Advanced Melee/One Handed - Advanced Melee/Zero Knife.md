A zero knife appears much like a folded switchblade, though the hilt is somewhat bulkier due to the battery; when activated, the zero knife forms a blade formed entirely of an aura of intense cold rather than steel. The frostbite-class zero knife is an easily obtained weapon whose blade rapidly accumulates flakes of frozen material in most atmospheres. The more advanced hailstorm-class, blizzard-class, avalancheclass, and icequake-class zero knives incorporate technology that eliminates the build-up.

# CRYO WEAPONS

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
