## Description

Eppro Enterprises doesn’t include this serum in its public catalogs, but the serum’s existence is an open secret. This shadowy fluid grants you a +2 insight bonus to Mysticism checks, and you can attempt checks with this skill untrained. While this serum is in effect, you can take a standard action to stop any bleed effect affecting you.
