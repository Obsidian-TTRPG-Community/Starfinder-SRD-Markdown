## Description

You fire a beam of radiation at an opponent. You must attempt a ranged attack against your opponent's EAC, adding your key ability score modifier instead of your Dexterity modifier if it's higher. On a hit, the target takes 8d12 fire damage and is exposed to high radiation. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or contract radiation sickness. The target isn't irradiated, and other nearby creatures don't need to attempt Fortitude saves to prevent radiation. The saving throw to resist the radiation effects is set by the spell rather than the standard save DC for radiation.
