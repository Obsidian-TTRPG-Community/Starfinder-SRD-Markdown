A modern take on the traditional weapon of the dragonkin, the dragonglaive is a polearm in which the large slashing blade is electrified via embedded circuitry. These weapons are generally so heavy that they can be used only by Large creatures or creatures with Strength modifiers of at least +4.

# Shock Weapons

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
