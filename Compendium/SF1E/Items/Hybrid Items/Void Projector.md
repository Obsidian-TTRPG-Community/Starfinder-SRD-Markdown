### Description

As a standard action, you can activate a void projector to transform a 20-foot-radius area into a zero-g environment. The area has no gravity. A void projector can operate for up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments. The device has a timer, which you can set as a move action, that enables the void projector to operate for a set number of minutes. You can deactivate a void projector as a swift action.
