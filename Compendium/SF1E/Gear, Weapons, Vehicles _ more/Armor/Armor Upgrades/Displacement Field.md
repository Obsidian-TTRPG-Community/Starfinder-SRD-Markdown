This optical device bends light around you. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. You can activate the _displacement field_ as a move action to gain the benefits of a _displacement_ spell until you spend another move action to deactivate it or it runs out of charges. A _displacement field’s_ charges replenish each day.
