# MENTAL MUSCLE
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 63_  
**Classes** Mystic 2, Precog 2, Technomancer 2, Witchwarper 2  
**School** transmutation  
**Casting Time** 1 swift action  
**Range** personal  
**Duration** 1 round  

## DESCRIPTION

You channel your mental mastery as magic that directly reinforces your body, allowing you to perform brief physical feats as acts of willpower. You gain one of the following three benefits of your choice.  
**Smart Strength:** You apply your Intelligence modifier in place of your Strength modifier for melee or thrown weapon attack rolls, melee damage rolls, ability checks, and skill checks.  
**Insightful Agility:** You apply your Wisdom modifier in place of your Dexterity modifier for attack rolls, Reflex saving throws, initiative checks, and calculating your Armor Class. Your armor’s maximum Dex bonus instead limits how much of your Wisdom modifier you can apply to AC.  
**Confident Endurance:** You apply your Charisma modifier in place of your Constitution modifier for Fortitude saving throws. You gain temporary Hit Points equal to your Charisma modifier × half your caster level.  
When you perform a full action, you can cast this spell as part of that action (and apply the spell’s effects to that action) rather than casting it as a swift action.
