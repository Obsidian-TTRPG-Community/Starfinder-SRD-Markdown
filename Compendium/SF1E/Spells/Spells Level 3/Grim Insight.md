## Description

You channel visions of a grim future into your target's mind. Attempt a melee attack against the target's EAC, adding the higher of your key ability modifier or your Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 6d10 damage and must attempt a Will saving throw. A target that fails is shaken for the duration. One who succeeds is shaken for only 1 round, and then the spell ends.

Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
