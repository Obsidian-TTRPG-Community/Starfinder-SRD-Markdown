## Description

You turn a pile of technological junk into a robot that can perform basic healing tasks.

You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a large broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any related electronic components or combination of the above as long as the junk is found in a large enough quantity. While casting this spell, you use your magic and technological know-how to rearrange the junked parts and infuse them with energy and medical skills.

A healing junkbot is Small, its KAC and EAC are each equal to 10 + your caster level, and it has a number of Hit Points equal to one-quarter of your own (but no Stamina Points). It has a land speed of 30 feet and a fly speed of 15 feet with average maneuverability. It is considered trained in the Medicine skill and can perform first aid, treat deadly wounds, and treat drugs or poison as if it had a medkit (though it can’t provide long-term care or treat disease). The junkbot has a total skill bonus for Medicine checks equal to 3 + your caster level.

A healing junkbot can drag or fly one unconscious creature at a time to any spot you designate. It can drag or fly a Small, Medium, or Large creature at half speed. It can drag or fly smaller creatures at normal speed, but it can’t move creatures bigger than Large. A healing junkbot can never attack. The junkbot uses your saving throw bonuses if it is the target of a spell or another targeted effect. For purposes of spells and effects that target it, the junkbot is treated as a construct with the technological and magical subtypes.

You can give new basic commands to your healing junkbot telepathically on your turn as a move action, and the junkbot can take actions as if it were a normal creature. You are aware when the bot has succeeded at or failed a skill check, as well as when it has been attacked or destroyed, but you can perceive nothing else through this basic telepathic link.

When the healing junkbot is destroyed or this spell ends, the electronic equipment you used to create it falls apart into refuse, its components and circuitry fried beyond anything recognizable. You can’t use this refuse as a target to create another junkbot.
