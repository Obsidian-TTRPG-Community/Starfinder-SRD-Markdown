Known far and wide for their fighting prowess, Sarenites who delve into the darkest corners of the universe often take the holy weapon of their goddess with them. A blaze scimitar is made of a metallic alloy that can be heated to blistering temperatures again and again through use of a an induction magnet. These golden blades glow bright orange when activated and shed light in a wide area when they strike a blow. Due to their weight and the power required to follow through with attacks, they must be wielded with two hands.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
