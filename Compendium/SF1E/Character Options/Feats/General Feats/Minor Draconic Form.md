Benefit: When you select polymorph as a spell known, you add dragon to the list of creature types you can select when designing polymorphed forms. Changing a target that isn’t a dragon into a dragon form grants them a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against paralysis and sleep effects. In addition, you can cast polymorph on yourself once per day as a 1st-level spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level. However, you can only use this spell-like ability to assume one predetermined form that has the dragon type.
