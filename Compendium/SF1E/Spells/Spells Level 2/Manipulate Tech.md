## DESCRIPTION

You can briefly align your will to the circuitry or structure of an unattended technological weapon or a technological item with a usage entry, provided the target has an item level equal to or lower than your caster level + 3. The target can even have the broken condition. When you do so, you can cause the item to act as if you activated it without moving it from its space. If the target is a weapon, you can cause it to fire or activate for the rest of your turn. Then, you can make one attack against a creature in range using your ranged attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier or your melee attack bonus plus your Intelligence modifier, whichever is applicable for the weapon you activate. If the target is a technological item with a usage entry, the item activates for the time listed in that usage entry. This spell provides any charges or ammunition used by your activation.
