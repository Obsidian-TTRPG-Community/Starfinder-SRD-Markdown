SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### SNIPER’S AIM (EX)

When the poacher makes a ranged attack against a target with cover, they reduce the AC bonus from cover by 2. A poacher can’t use sniper’s aim against an enemy with total cover.

ABOUT

Poachers hunt creatures, including sometimes sentient creatures, that they are not supposed to, for thrill and/ or profit.
