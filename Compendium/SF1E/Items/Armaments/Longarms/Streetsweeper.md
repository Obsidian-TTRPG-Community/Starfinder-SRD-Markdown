## Streetsweeper
Streetsweepers are sonic weapons designed to deliver a low-intensity “punch” of sound. A streetsweeper can be overcharged to deliver a significant sonic blast that can knock down its target.

#### Sonic Weapons
Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
