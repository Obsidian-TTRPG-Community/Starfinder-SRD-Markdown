Androids can gain the benefits of certain armor upgrades by simply installing them into their bodies. This augmentation usually consists of a metallic recess in or attached to a chosen system (an arm, foot, hand, leg, or at the base of the spinal column). Regardless of whether you are wearing physical armor, you can install any one armor upgrade into this slot that could be installed into light armor. Regardless of the system, you can have only one upgrade slot graft installed.
