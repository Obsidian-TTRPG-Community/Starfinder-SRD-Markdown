### Description

This flexible body stocking fits tightly against its wearer and can be worn under ordinary clothes. If a second skin matches the wearer’s skin tone, this type of light armor can be difficult to detect. A second skin can also accept upgrades, making it popular for celebrities, diplomats, and other individuals who want protection without appearing to wear armor.
