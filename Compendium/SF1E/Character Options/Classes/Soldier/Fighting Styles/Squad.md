# Squad
name:: Squad
source:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 33_  
desc:: Soldiers in large organizations, such as the Stewards, learn to fight effectively together in small squads. You have mastered these techniques, and your combat skills focus on aiding your allies. Halfelves epitomize the cooperative spirit this style taps into.

## Coordinated Aim (EX)
level-1:: Coordinated Aim (EX) -You can help squad mates hit targets even if youâ€™re in the way. You gain Coordinated Shot as a bonus feat. Your allies gain the bonus even if you are providing cover to the target. If you already have that feat, you gain a bonus combat feat instead.  

## Quick Backup (EX)
level-5:: Quick Backup (EX) -As a full action, you can move up to twice your speed and make one attack, but your target must be a creature threatening an ally. Once you have used this ability, you cannot do so again until you have taken a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.  

## Mystic Swap (SU)
level-9:: Mystic Swap (SU) -As a move action, you can expend 1 Resolve Point to teleport, switching places with one ally within 60 feet.  

## Precise Flanker (EX)
level-13:: Precise Flanker (EX) - You and allies who flank a foe with you gain an extra +1 bonus (+3 total) to your melee attack rolls against that target. If the flanked creature takes a guarded step, it provokes attacks of opportunity from you and allies who flank it with you.  

## Share Training (EX)
level-17:: Share Training (EX) - Select three combat feats you have. When you start your turn adjacent to an ally, as a reaction, you can select one of these feats and grant the ally its benefit for 1 round. To benefit from the selected feat, the ally must still meet its prerequisites.
