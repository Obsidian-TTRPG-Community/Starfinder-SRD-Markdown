# Rageshkor, Rock

Fierce, armored saurians, rageshkors are among Vesk Prime’s most famous fauna. These beasts evolved alongside the planet’s other aggressive wildlife, leading to deadly evolutions unknown to other thyreophorans, most notably movable armor plates, and tail spikes rageshkors can hurl at distant threats.

Vesk have long seen rageshkors as worthy foes. Records from before the Gap show that hunting rageshkors is an age‑old tradition, with accomplished hunters regularly wearing the hard-won hide, plates, and spikes. These cultural values have survived into modern times, and vesk and non-vesk alike regularly travel to Vesk Prime specifically for the chance to hunt a rageshkor. The most dedicated hunters equip themselves with archaic weaponry in the spirit of tradition, but even modern armaments are no guarantee of an easy fight.

The smaller green rageshkors are the most prolific species, still prevalent in Vesk Prime’s forests and plains. Adolescents typically break from their birth herd, roaming either alone or in small cohorts. These roving rageshkors are especially aggressive, and they often pick fights with passersby, land transports, and even small buildings.

The might and ferocity of green rageshkors pale in comparison to those of their larger kin, rock rageshkors. These rare animals are typically solitary, and during less prosperous times, rock rageshkors hunker down into a form of hibernation. Combined with their camouflaged bodies and the accumulation of windblown debris, these animals often fade into the landscape, snapping to vicious alertness only to ambush prey that mistakes it for a boulder.

### Special Abilities

**Align Frill (Ex)** As a move action, a rageshkor can align portions of the flexible frills on its back armor to block attacks from one enemy the rageshkor is observing. Doing so grants the rageshkor two benefits against that enemy’s attacks until the start of the rageshkor’s next turn: the rageshkor’s AC increases by 2 and its fire and cold resistances each increase to 10.  
**Control Breath (Ex)** A rock rageshkor is unaffected by thin atmosphere and treats severely thin atmosphere as thin atmosphere (Core Rulebook 396). In addition, a rock rageshkor can hold its breath for 1 hour. Taking actions does not reduce this duration.  
**Spike (Ex)** By whipping its tail, a green rageshkor can hurl a detachable spike from just below its spiked tail club as a ranged attack with a range increment of 20 feet and a maximum range of 100 feet. The creature can hurl only six such spikes in a 24-hour period.  
**Sweep (Ex)** Each target for Cleave and Great Cleave must be within 15 feet of the previous target, rather than adjacent to the previous target, but it must still be within the rock rageshkor’s reach.
