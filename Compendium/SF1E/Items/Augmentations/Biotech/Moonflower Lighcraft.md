# Moonflower Lighcraft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 2 pg. 85_  
**Level**:: 8
**Price**::  8500 
**System**:: Hand  
This implant can be used to produce light like a flashlight with a 30-foot cone, drawing power from you. In addition, as a standard action, you can raise your augmented hand and create a blinding burst of light in a 30-foot cone-shaped burst extending from your hand. A creature that can see in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. Once you activate this ability, you can’t activate it again that day unless you spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it.
