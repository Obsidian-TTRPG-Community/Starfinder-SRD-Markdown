# Spell Reflector

You can activate a _spell reflector_ as a reaction when you’re targeted by a spell. This does not affect spells that include an area you are in or affect you in other ways; it affects only those that target you specifically. The spell is reflected on its caster, as if the caster had been the target. The type of _spell reflector_ determines the highest level of spell it can reflect. A _spell reflector’s_ charge replenishes each day.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor. 

-   **Mk 1**: You can reflect a spell of 4th level or lower.
-   **Mk 2**: You can reflect a spell of 6th level or lower.
