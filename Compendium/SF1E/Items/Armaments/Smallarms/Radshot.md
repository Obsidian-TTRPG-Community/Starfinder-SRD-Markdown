# Radshot

Banned in most civilized regions of the Pact Worlds, radshots are known for the reckless amount of radiation they generate. Despite the objections of the living, radshotsâ€™ signature short barrels and bulky containment sheaths can often be seen in the markets of Eox or at the hip of a Corpse Fleet officer. They are named for the type of radiation waves they emit: electromagnetic, neutron, and rapid-decay.

### Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
