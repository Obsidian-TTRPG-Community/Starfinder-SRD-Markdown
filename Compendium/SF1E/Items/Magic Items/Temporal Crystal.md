### Description

After rolling an initiative check, and before anyone else’s initiative results are revealed, you can use a _temporal crystal_ to adjust your position in time. Choose a number between 1 and 25; this number becomes your initiative count for that combat. In the case of a tie, you go before any characters who rolled that initiative count. A _temporal crystal_ can be used only once, which destroys the crystal.
