# EXIT POD
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 205_  
**Item Level** 4; **Price** 1,750  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Heavy, Powered; **Bulk** 2  
This body harness fits into a suit of powered armor or is built into the frame of heavy armor, allowing you to exit the armor as a move action instead of as a full action. Entering the armor is no faster with an exit pod.  
  
This can be installed only in heavy armor or powered armor.
