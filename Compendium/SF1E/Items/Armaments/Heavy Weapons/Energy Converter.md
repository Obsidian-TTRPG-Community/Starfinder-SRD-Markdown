# Energy Converter

Boxy devices covered with various gauges and protruding antennae, energy converters resemble dangerously experimental pieces of hardware. These devices invert matter-antimatter annihilation; instead of generating massive amounts of heat from a tiny speck of matter, an energy converter generates a tiny speck of matter by drawing an incredible amount of heat energy from a nearby area. Tactical, advanced, and elite energy converters each create relatively larger flecks of matter, drawing their energy from a larger area in order to do so.

### Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
