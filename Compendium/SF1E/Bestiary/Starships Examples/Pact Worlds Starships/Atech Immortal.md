## DESCRIPTION

Severe and pugnacious, the Immortal is the workhorse capital ship of military fleets like those of the Stewards and the Knights of Golarion. Thickly armored and loaded with weapons, this cruiser rarely needs to fire a shot in most conflicts, as its mere appearance in-system can stop a conflict cold and send all but the most militant threats running for the safety of the Drift.
