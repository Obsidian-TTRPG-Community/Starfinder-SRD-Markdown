## Description

You create an anti-telepathic field around yourself. A creature within the area attempting to communicate or gain information using telepathy or limited telepathy, or attempting to cast the spells _detect thoughts_, _mind link_, _mind probe_, _telepathic bond_, _telepathic message_, or _telepathy_—or abilities that work as those spells, such as the mindlink and telepathic bond mystic class features—must succeed at a caster level check (DC = 15 + your caster level). On a failure, the effect targeting you fails.
