A garage must be mounted on a ship thatâ€™s Small or larger. It can store 1 Large or smaller terrestrial vehicle. While a vehicle is housed in a garage, repairs on it take half the time. A vehicle can be deployed from the garage directly to the surface if the ship has landed, or it can be loaded into an available drop pod (Starfinder Starship Operations Manual 25) or sky crane (page 29).
