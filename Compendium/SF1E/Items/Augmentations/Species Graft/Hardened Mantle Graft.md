Ijtikris are protected by stone-like shells on their heads and lower mantles. Your own skin has been strengthened with nanofibers or mystical alloys, granting you a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against critical hit effects. In addition, you reduce the damage you take from a critical hit by an amount equal to your character level + your Constitution bonus to a minimum of 1, or to 0 if you also have another means of reduction.
