## Description

You summon the body of a deceased creature that has been dead for no longer than 1 day per caster level from its current position to your side. Deceased creatures up to Large size can be summoned from any location, on any plane, regardless of the current state of their body. The body doesn't come with any objects or possessions. This spell fails automatically if the deceased has been returned to life or is undead. This spell can't be used to summon corpses from the Drift to another plane, or from another plane to the Drift.

Casting this spell requires you to create a complex representation of the target body, worth at least 10,000 credits, to serve as a beacon for the body's return. This object is consumed when you cast the spell.
