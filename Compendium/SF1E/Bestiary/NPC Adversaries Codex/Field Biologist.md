# Field Biologist

Though many are students and educators at formal institutions, scholars are as likely to be solitary academics or self-taught. Adventurers might seek a scholar to decipher a mysterious text or perform a complicated spell. A scholar could be a party’s patron, sending them to retrieve artifacts or data from faraway planets. Villainous scholars might seek nefarious lore or publish dangerously fabricated research for profit or prestige.  
These scholars have Intelligence-focused skills, yet you can replace these skills to represent other studies, such as a scholar of the arts having Profession (painter) instead of Engineering.

### Special Abilities

**Precise Aim (Ex)** When a field biologist scores a critical hit, their attack deals additional damage equal to their CR, applied after doubling the attack’s damage.  
**Wrassle (Ex)** A field researcher can attempt a grapple combat maneuver with a +4 bonus as a full action. If they succeed, they can deal nonlethal damage to the target equal to their claw damage in addition to the grapple check’s other effects.

## Description

Field biologists specialize in wilderness research and are often equipped with nonlethal weapons to subdue creatures so they can be carefully studied, chipped, and released back into the wild. Those who survive numerous expeditions often earn a reputation for resourcefulness and grit, attracting junior researchers and other colleagues. Most biologists deeply respect the life-forms they study, but some seek to capture creatures to perform illegal and harmful experiments for the sake of profit.
