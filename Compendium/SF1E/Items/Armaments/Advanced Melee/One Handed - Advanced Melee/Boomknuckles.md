Covering the hand and held in place with a horizontal grip, a set of boomknuckles resembles a heavy gauntlet. The weapon projects bone-shattering blasts at its highest setting, though more controlled bursts allow a user to hurl themselves over distances with ease. These weapons are often favored by parkour enthusiasts who use them to project blasts downward to vault over obstacles or leap incredible distances, often to the dismay of security personnel in the area.

# Sonic Weapons

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
