# Mass Simulator

A specialized mass driver enables smaller vessels to tug larger vessels or objects in busy docks or mining operations. When using a weapon with the tractor beam special property, the mass simulator allows the firing vessel to affect ships a number of size categories larger thatâ€™s equal to its mk level. For example, a Small ship with a mk 4 mass simulator can target and move a Gargantuan vessel with a gravity gun.
