Your winning and adaptable personality gains you access to less-reputable professional services.

**Prerequisites**: Diplomacy 5 ranks.

**Benefit**: When using services in a settlement—such as lodgings, professional services, or transportation— you can tap into a settlement’s gray market to pay half price for the service. If you do, there’s a 25% chance something goes wrong, subject to the GM’s discretion: a spell might wear off early, a lodging might be attacked in the middle of the night, or transportation might break down in the middle of a journey.  
In addition, reduce the DC of Culture checks to recall knowledge about the criminal underworld by 2.
