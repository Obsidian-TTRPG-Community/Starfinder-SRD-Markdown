A meal is usually purchased close to the time it is consumed, often at a restaurant or from a street vendor. Most such meals are mass produced in the Pact Worlds, and it is relatively cheap and easy to get food in just about any remotely civilized area. Poor-quality meals are either nutritious but bland, or tasty but unhealthy. Common-quality meals are both tasty and nourishing. Good meals are gourmet in taste and offer higherquality nutrition.
