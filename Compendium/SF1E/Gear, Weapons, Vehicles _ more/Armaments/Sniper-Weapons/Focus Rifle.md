# FOCUS RIFLE
This elongated laser rifle contains additional lenses that further focus its output, creating a powerful beam that can punch through many substances at ranges far greater than those of a typical laser rifle. Dual, triple, and quad focus rifles use increasing numbers of focusing lenses, intensifying the laser but compounding the price. A compound focus rifle’s lenses are specially made of a rare form of glass, creating the most powerful output currently possible for such weapons.

### LASER WEAPONS

Laser weapons emit highly focused beams of light that deal fire damage. These beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.

Laser weapons use various means to concentrate beams of light into deadly intensity. Some focus light through a faceted crystal, while others focus the beam through a chemical cloud or ionized gas.
