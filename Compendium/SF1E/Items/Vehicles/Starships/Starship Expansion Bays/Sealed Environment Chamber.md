# Sealed Environment Chamber

**PCU** 2; **Cost (in BP)** 1  
Occasionally, a starship will need to host an alien or other creature whose biology is radically different from that of the crew. The passenger might be able to breathe only methane gas or can survive in only below-freezing temperatures. In such a case, a sealed environment chamber is required for the passenger to remain comfortable (and alive).
