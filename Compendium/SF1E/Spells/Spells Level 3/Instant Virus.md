## Description

You overwhelm your target’s programming, installing a dangerous self-replicating programming virus. This works like a physical or mental disease (your choice), except it ignores the target’s immunity to diseases. The programming virus has a frequency of 1 hour and requires two consecutive saving throws to cure. _Detect affliction_ can reveal the existence of this virus in a construct (the virus is considered a disease for purposes of that spell). Additionally, _remove affliction_ can remove this virus.
