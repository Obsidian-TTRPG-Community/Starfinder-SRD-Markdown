# Fold Gates

**Engine Rating** Special  
**Minimum PCU** 200; **Maximum Size** Huge  
  
Found in scattered locations deep in the Vast, _fold gates_ are an ancient magical means of interstellar travel designed to foil the speed limit of the universe. _Fold gates_ don’t enable a starship to travel at speeds faster than light—the magic “folds” the space between two gates instead, and a vessel simply passes through the gates in a near-instantaneous transition from one physical location to another.  
Unfortunately, repeated use of _fold gates_ caused strain on the most heavily traveled routes, weakening the fabric of space-time and in some cases stretching and ripping it like badly worn cloth, causing disasters such as the disappearance of entire star systems. Most of these dangerously distorted fold gate routes eventually disintegrated, with the gates themselves collapsing into black holes or becoming mystical hazards that can ensnare unwary ships in strange, labyrinthine demiplanes. _Fold gates_ are known to have been in use even before the Gap, but the original builders of the _fold gates_ and the techniques for creating them have been lost to history. Some stable, functional _fold gates_ still remain, but all the gates discovered to date have been found in the Vast, and the entire network of linked gates has yet to be fully mapped. Starship captains use _fold gates_ at their own risk, but they remain an option for daring pilots seeking shortcuts through the galaxy.  
Journeying between a pair of _fold gates_ usually takes only 1d8 hours, but travel is limited to predetermined destinations—those locations with functioning _fold gates_ (determined by the GM). _Fold gates_ have no BP cost, as no special engines are needed to use them, but they drain an immense amount of power from vessels passing through them to maintain the stability of the folded space they create. _Fold gates_ are physical objects, so only Huge or smaller starships can fit through them.
