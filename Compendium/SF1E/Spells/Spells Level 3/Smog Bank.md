## Description

You create a noxious cloud similar to _fog cloud_ that is harmful to living creatures. _Smog bank_ obscures sight just as _fog cloud_ does. Living creatures without environmental protections that are in the area when the spell is cast or who enter the area must attempt a Fortitude save or be sickened for as long as they remain in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter.
