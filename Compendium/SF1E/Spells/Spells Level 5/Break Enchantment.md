## Description

This spell frees victims from curses, enchantments, and transmutations. _Break enchantment_ can reverse even an instantaneous effect. For each such effect, you attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level, maximum +15) against a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the effect. Success means that the creature is free of the spell, curse, or effect. For a cursed magic item, the DC of the caster level check is equal to the DC of the curse.

If the spell is one that can’t be dispelled by _dispel magic_, _break enchantment_ works only if that spell is 5th level or lower. If the effect comes from a permanent magic item, _break enchantment_ doesn’t remove the curse from the item but it does free the victim from the item’s effects.
