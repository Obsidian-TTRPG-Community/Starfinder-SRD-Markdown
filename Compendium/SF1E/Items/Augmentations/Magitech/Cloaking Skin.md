# Cloaking Skin

Many of your pores are replaced with magically regulated and directed holographic projectors that work together to automatically match your surrounding environment, rendering you invisible per _invisibility_. Once per day, you can enable your cloaking skin as a standard action, turning you invisible for 10 minutes. A greater cloaking skin functions as _greater invisibility_, but the effect lasts for only 10 rounds. You can disable either model of cloaking skin as a move action.
