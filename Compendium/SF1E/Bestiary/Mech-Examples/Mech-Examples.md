# Sample Mechs

source:  _Tech Revolution pg. 92_
Pages 112–119 present more than a dozen examples of mechs from cultures across the galaxy, such as the Azlanti Imperator Pinion, the Daimalko Valkor, the Idaran Breacher, and the Veskarium’s Warmander. The mechs detailed there are of course just examples
far stranger and rarer models are manufactured across the galaxy, as well as near-infinite custom-built mechs found throughout the Starfinder setting.
