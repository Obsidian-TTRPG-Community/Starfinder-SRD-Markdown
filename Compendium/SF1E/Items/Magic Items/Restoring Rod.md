### Description

Helixes and other geometric patterns swirl within the clear shaft of a _restoring rod_, which is capped with gold on each end. To use the rod, you must hold it. After you roll dice to determine the number of Hit Points or the amount of ability damage restored by a spell or effect you create, you can activate the rod if any of those dice have a result of 1 or 2. Doing so is part of the same action you took to cast the spell or create the effect. If you activate the rod, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add 2 to each die with a result of 1 or 2. Once per day, the rod can be activated to gain its benefits without requiring the user to spend a Resolve Point.
