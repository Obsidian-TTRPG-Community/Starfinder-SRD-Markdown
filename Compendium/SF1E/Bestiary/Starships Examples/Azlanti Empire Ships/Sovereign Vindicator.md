## Description

A massive dreadnought that can obliterate most spacefaring enemies and challenge space stations, a Sovereign Vindicator flies at the head of an armada to terminate incursions into the empire or take over new systems. In annexation operations, a Vindicator acts as a frontline assault vessel with drone carriers and Harrier fighters for support. In a second line, along with defensive warships, transport vessels such as Sumpters hold positions away from the naval conflict to avoid unnecessary losses. Barring the need for targeted assaults planetside, any ground invasion begins only after Vindicators and their flotillas have eliminated spaceborne threats.  
 
Vindicator command is among the highest privileges in the Imperial Fleet, given only to pure-blooded Azlanti who can be trusted with such destructive potential. Therefore, a duxillar or Azlanti noble of higher station usually captains one of these dreadnoughts. Members of the royal family command Vindicators that guard the Aristia system and New Thespera.
