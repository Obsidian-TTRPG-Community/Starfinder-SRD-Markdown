name:: Armor-Piercing Stab 
type:: Ex
source:: Interstellar Species pg. 33
desc:: Your strikes open brief gaps in your targets’ armor. When you hit with a weapon that deals piercing damage as part of a full attack, any additional attacks you make against that target before the beginning of your next turn target the creature’s EAC rather than its KAC.
