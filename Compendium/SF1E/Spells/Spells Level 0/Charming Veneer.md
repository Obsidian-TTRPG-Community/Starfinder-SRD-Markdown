## DESCRIPTION

You pull gossamer threads from other, more genteel realities and wrap the target in them, smoothing the edges of their personality and accentuating their charms. The target gains a +1 circumstance bonus to Charisma checks and Charisma-based skill checks. Additionally, a creature affected by this spell can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in only 10 minutes. Once any individual under the effects of a _charming veneer_ spell you cast has used this benefit to gather information in a specific settlement or local region, no target of a _charming veneer_ spell you cast can do so again for 24 hours.
