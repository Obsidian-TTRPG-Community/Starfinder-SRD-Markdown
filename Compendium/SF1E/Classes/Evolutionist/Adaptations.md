# ADAPTATIONS

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
You learn your first adaptation at 2nd level and you gain an additional adaptation every 2 levels thereafter. Some require you meet additional prerequisites.

## 2ND LEVEL

You must be at least 2nd level to select these adaptations.  

###  DAZZLING OUTBURST (SU)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
As a reaction when you spend 2 or more MP, you can perform a flashy display that dazzles adjacent enemies for 1 round (Reflex negates). If you have spent 4 or more MP since the end of your last turn when you activate this adaptation, you can cause one of the dazzled creatures to instead be blinded for 1 round. Once you use this adaptation you can’t do so again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.

###  DISTANT STRIKES (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
Increase the range increments of your ranged adaptive strike by 50%. As a swift action, you can spend 1 MP either to increase your ranged adaptive strike’s range increment by 100% (rather than by 50%) or to grant your melee adaptive strike the reach weapon special property; either effect lasts until the start of your next turn.

###  INVERT FORM (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
As a reaction, when an effect moves you or gives you the flat-footed, off-kilter, off-target, or prone condition, you can spend 2 MP to reorient your body, negating one of those conditions and reducing the distance you’re moved by 5 feet.

###  OCULAR ADVANTAGE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
You gain one of the following special abilities: darkvision (60 feet), low-light vision, or the unflankable universal creature rule, chosen when you learn this adaptation. If you choose darkvision and already have it, you instead increase the range of your darkvision by 30 feet. As a move action, you can spend 1 MP to gain the abilities you didn’t select for 1 minute.

###  RESISTANT FORM (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
You can temporarily change your body’s composition, helping you shrug off harmful energies. When you learn this adaptation choose three of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You can spend 1 MP as a move action to gain energy resistance to one of the energy types you chose. The value of this energy resistance equals 1 + half your evolutionist level, stacks with one other source of energy resistance you might have, and lasts for 3 rounds.  
You can learn this adaptation a second time; this allows you to spend MP to gain resistance to any of the five energy types.

###  VERSATILE STRIKE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
As a swift action (or part of the full action used to make a full attack), you can spend 1 MP to transform your adaptive strike’s damage type until the beginning of your next turn. If your adaptive strike deals kinetic damage, you can have it deal any kinetic damage type instead. If your adaptive strike deals energy damage, you can have it deal any energy damage type instead.

## 6TH LEVEL

You must be at least 6th level to select these adaptations.  

###  AREA STRIKE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
You can briefly empower your adaptive strike to strike large areas, such as launching hails of projectiles, breathing a gout of fire, battering foes with a flurry of tentacles, or skewering multiple foes with an elongated claw. You can spend 2 MP as a standard action to make one attack with your adaptive strike as though it had the blast weapon special property (affecting a 20-foot cone) or the line weapon special property (affecting a 40-foot line). For each additional MP you spend to activate this adaptation, you increase the cone’s length by 5 feet or increase the line’s length by 10 feet.

###  ENHANCED MOBILITY (NO)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
You gain one of the following: a climb speed equal to your land speed, a swim speed equal to your land speed, or a fly speed (average maneuverability) equal to your land speed, chosen when you learn this adaptation. In addition, when you spend 2 MP to gain a climb or swim speed, the effect lasts for 1 minute. You can select this adaptation up to three times, selecting a different speed each time.

###  EXTRAORDINARY SENSE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
You can manifest physiology for sensing your surroundings in exceptional ways. Choose two of the following senses: life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration. You gain blindsense with a range of 20 feet using those senses. As a move action, you can spend 2 MP to increase the range of the blindsense granted by this ability to 60 feet for 1 minute.

###  FEARSOME OUTBURST (SU)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
As a reaction when you spend 2 or more MP to use an adaptation, you can use Intimidate to demoralize a creature within 30 feet. If you have spent 4 or more MP since the end of your last turn when you activate this adaptation, you can either attempt to demoralize up to two additional creatures or you can cause a creature you successfully demoralized to also become frightened for 1 round (Will negates the frightened effect). Once you use this adaptation, you can’t do so again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.

## 10TH LEVEL

You must be at least 10th level to select these adaptations.  

###  AUGMENTED POTENTIAL (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 16_  
Your augmentations act as batteries for your own transformative powers. Once per day as a move action, you can draw energy and inspiration from your augmentations to gain Mutation Points. The maximum number of MP you gain in this way equals either one-fourth your evolutionist level or the sum of your augmentations’ item levels divided by 10, whichever is lower. Only augmentations of the types associated with your niche contribute to this augmentation item level sum.

###  ENHANCED RESISTANCE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
When you activate your resistant form adaptation as a move action, you increase its duration by a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier and you increase the value of its resistance by 2. You can activate resistant form as a reaction, but its MP cost increases to 2.  
You must have the resistant form adaptation to select this adaptation.

###  EXTREME MOBILITY (NO)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
When you spend 2 MP to gain a climb or swim speed, you can instead gain a burrow speed equal to half your land speed for the effect’s duration. If you have the enhanced mobility adaptation, you can increase the swim speed it grants to 1-1/2 × your land speed, and you can improve the maneuverability of its fly speed to perfect.

###  FORCEFUL OUTBURST (SU)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
Your more powerful transformations can knock back bystanders. As a reaction when you spend 2 or more MP to use an adaptation, you can push away one or more creatures adjacent to you, moving them 5 feet away as if you had succeeded at a bull rush attempt against them (Fortitude negates). This movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. When you activate this adaptation, if you’ve spent 4 or more MP since the end of your last turn, you also make any pushed creature flat-footed until the end of your next turn. Once you use this adaptation, you can’t do so again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.

## 14TH LEVEL

You must be at least 14th level to select these adaptations.  

###  CONTROLLED TRANSFORMATION (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
You expertly control your body’s adaptive quirks to mitigate your transformation’s drawbacks. If you have at least 1 MP, you treat your MP total as though it were 1 higher (to a maximum of your normal MP maximum) for the purpose of determining your instinct effects and you treat your MP total as though it were 1 lower (minimum 1 MP) for the purpose of determining your drawback effects.

###  EXPLOSIVE STRIKE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
You can spend 2 MP as a standard action to make an attack with your ranged adaptive strike as though it had the explode (10 feet) weapon special property. For each additional MP you spend to activate this adaptation, you can increase the explosion’s radius by 5 feet. Reduce this attack’s damage by an amount equal to half your evolutionist level.

###  PINPOINT SENSE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
When you activate your extraordinary sense adaptation, you instead gain blindsight to a range of 20 feet with the chosen sense and blindsense with the chosen sense to a range of 60 feet.  
You must have the extraordinary sense adaptation to select this adaptation.

###  VIOLENT OUTBURST (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
As a reaction when you spend 2 or more MP to use an adaptation, you can make an attack with your adaptive strike with a –2 penalty to the attack roll. If you use your ranged adaptive strike for this attack, the target must be within your weapon’s first range increment. If you have spent 5 or more MP since the end of your last turn when you activate this adaptation, you can either make the attack without the –2 penalty, or you can attack up to two targets with a –4 penalty applied to each attack roll. Once you use this adaptation, you can’t do so again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.

## 18TH LEVEL

You must be at least 18th level to select these adaptations.  

###  FISSION FORM (SU)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
Once per day as a move action, you can create a copy of yourself that instantaneously severs itself from your body and appears in an adjacent space. Your copy shares your statistics, lasts for 5 minutes, and has a number of Hit Points and Stamina Points both equal to 3 × your evolutionist level. Your copy appears with your adaptive strike manifested but beyond simple replicas of your apparel, it lacks equipment and can take only move actions.  
In combat, both you and your copy share the same initiative count, with one acting immediately after the other. Each turn, either you or your copy can use a full round’s worth of actions and the other can take only a move action, though you can spend 1 MP to allow both to use a full round of actions for 1 round. Your copy acts and thinks independently, though it follows your instructions. You and your copy can both use your adaptations, evolution track, and adaptive strike, but your copy doesn’t have or gain MP; it uses your MP total and you must spend your MP to use its adaptations.  
Maintaining your copy in combat is taxing. At the start of your turn after gaining MP, you must spend 1 MP to sustain your copy that round. Each full minute you sustain your copy, the MP cost per round to sustain it increases by 1. If you don’t sustain your copy, or if your copy is reduced to 0 HP, it dissolves into nothingness.

###  REGENERATIVE FORM (SU)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 17_  
Choose two of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. By spending 2 MP at the beginning of your turn, you gain regeneration 10 for 1 round and immediately regain 10 Hit Points. Your regeneration stops functioning for 1 round whenever you take energy damage of either of the two types you selected. At the start of each turn, you can sustain your regeneration for an additional round by spending a number of MP equal to 2 + half the number of rounds your regeneration has been active since the last time you rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.  
You can activate this adaptation even if you’re dying and otherwise unable to take actions.
