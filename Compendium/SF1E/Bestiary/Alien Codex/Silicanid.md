## DESCRIPTION

As their name implies, silicanids are canids native to Weydana-1 that have inorganic, silicone-based bodies that resemble obsidian and magma more than flesh and blood; even their coats are a collection of soot and ash instead of fur. Doglike in both appearance and behavior, silicanids are natural hunters just like their carbon-based cousins, and they’re armed with teeth and claws of solid quartz. They instinctually chase down their prey, even burrowing into dens when necessary.  
  
As companions, silicanids have a well-earned reputation as excellent varmint-hunters, due to their small stature and tenacity. Their aura of warmth makes them especially popular among vesk and other cold-blooded species, and they are much in demand as therapy animals or as companions in frigid environments. Silicanids are pack animals in the wild, and they form a fierce bond with others.
