## Description

Made popular by sarcesian snipers, this spell allows you to peer a split second into the future to line up a perfect shot. The next time you attempt an attack with a ranged weapon before the end of this turn, roll your attack twice and keep the better result. Casting this spell counts as aiming a sniper weapon as a move action for the purposes of the sniper weapon special property.
