## Description

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing or unconscious creatures are linked by hand in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by a single casting of _plane shift_. Arriving at a precise location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane (except for the Drift), though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from the last place one of the targets (your choice) was located last time that target traveled to that plane. If itâ€™s the first time traveling to a particular plane for all targets, you appear at a random location on the plane, though you can use other means of transit, such as _interplanetary teleport_, to travel on the new plane. Mystics must have an object attuned to a specific plane or native to that plane in order to use _plane shift_ to travel to a plane. A technomancer requires a planar navigational program for a specific plane in order to travel to that plane with _plane shift_. Special rituals, jealously hoarded by powerful technomancers and mystics, can allow you to travel to specific locations on the chosen plane, or even to unknown worlds.
