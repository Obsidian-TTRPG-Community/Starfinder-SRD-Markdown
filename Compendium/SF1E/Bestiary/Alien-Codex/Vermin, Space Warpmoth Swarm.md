## Warpmoth Swarm Cr 6

Even the vacuum of space has bugs. Most of these void-dwelling vermin are harmless, but some are dangerous or predatory.
Asteroid lice and planetoid beetles feed on minerals in the rock of their airless habitats. Asteroid lice are communal, but planetoid beetles are territorial, tolerating only one mate. These creatures and their eggs can float in space to a new home. However, careless quarrying and shipping have accelerated their spread through the galaxy.
Xenobiologists theorize many space vermin evolved in special circumstances. Necropedes were once centipede-like scavengers on Eox
they now have a bite that can digest undead flesh. A warpmoth is like a glowing blue-white speck attracted to moving light, such as other warpmoths or passing starships. Gathering in swarms and following ships helps the moths feed and mate. Comet wasps create nests in frozen interstellar bodies. These icy, venomous vespids lay their eggs in living creatures.
