# Fearmonger

This collapsible, lightweight piece of military surplus looks like a loudspeaker set atop tripod legs. Setting up and positioning a fearmonger takes a move action, and you can activate it from up to 60 feet away as a standard action twice per day. When activated, the fearmonger unleashes a magically enhanced subsonic burst in a 30-foot cone that scares nearby creatures, with the effect varying by the device’s model. This is a mind-affecting, sonic, and fear effect. Once a creature has attempted a saving throw against the device, it’s immune to subsequent uses of fearmongers for 24 hours.
