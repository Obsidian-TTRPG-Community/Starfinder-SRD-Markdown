### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Horrific Shriek (Su)** Every 1d4 rounds, a bhanda can shriek as a standard action. All creatures within 30 feet except for you must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the bhanda’s level + the bhanda’s Charisma modifier) or gain the shaken condition for 1 round. Creatures that fail their saving throw against a bhanda’s horrific shriek can’t be affected by that bhanda’s horrific shriek for 24 hours.  
**Unnerving Gaze (Su)** As long as your bhanda is adjacent to you, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Intimidate checks against creatures within 30 ft. that can see your bhanda, and the DC of any spell you cast with the fear descriptor increases by 1.
