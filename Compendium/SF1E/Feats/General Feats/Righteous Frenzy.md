Benefit: When you activate your frenzy species trait, choose either destructive or healing energy. If you choose destructive energy, whenever you observe an enemy deal Hit Points damage to one of your allies during your frenzy, your next successful attack against that enemy before the end of your next turn deals additional force damage equal to 1 + 1/2 your level. If you choose healing energy, whenever you observe an enemy deal Hit Points damage to one of your allies during your frenzy, your next successful attack against that enemy before the end of your next turn causes an ally who has 0 Stamina Points to regain a number of Stamina Points equal to 1 + 1/2 your level. Even if you witness enemies harming your allies multiple times, you can’t deal additional damage or restore Stamina Points in this way more than once per round.
