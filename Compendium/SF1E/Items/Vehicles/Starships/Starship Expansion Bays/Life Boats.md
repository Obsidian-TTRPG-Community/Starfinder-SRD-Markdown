# Life Boats

**PCU**:: 5
**Cost (in BP)**:: 3  
A life boat is a more sophisticated version of an escape pod. It has room for one Large creature, or two Medium or smaller creatures, and enough supplies to last those passengers 15 days (or 30 days of supplies for one Medium or smaller creature). While it has the same kind of distress beacon as an escape pod, a life boat also has an on-board computer that automatically detects the nearest hospitable celestial body and minimal thrusters to get the craft there (though a life boat canâ€™t participate in starship combat). A single expansion bay can be converted into two life boats.
