# SINGULARITY ACCELERATIONIST
Those who amass extraordinary wealth, power, and influence often use them to perpetuate their advantages, typically through violent or coercive means. Tyrants might maintain their rule through subterfuge and surveillance or through age-old and expedient threats and brute force. What unifies tyrants across philosophical and ideological divides is the willingness and ruthlessness to pursue extraordinarily ends to justify their means, often at a terrible cost to those who dare oppose them.
