This upgrade consists of several magical metal rings that project holographic images onto your armor, completely hiding its real appearance. As a standard action, you can change the appearance of your armor to any set of normal clothes or another type of light or heavy armor. This functions as _disguise self_, but it is only capable of changing the appearance of your armor, not yourself or the rest of your equipment.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
