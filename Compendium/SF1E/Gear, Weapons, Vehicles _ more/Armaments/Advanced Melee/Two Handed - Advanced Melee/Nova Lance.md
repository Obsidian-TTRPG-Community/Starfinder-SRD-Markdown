This long weapon bears a plasma sheath at its striking tip. Although similar weapons are produced on many worlds, nova lancesâ€™ use in Eoxian racing broadcasts has made them especially popular throughout the Pact Worlds. They are typically manufactured by corporations that specialize in plasma pistols and plasma rifles and thus their models follow the same naming conventions: red star, yellow star, white star, and blue star.

# PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
