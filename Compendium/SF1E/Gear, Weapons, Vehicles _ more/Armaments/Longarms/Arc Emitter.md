# ARC EMITTER
Arc emitters discharge a cone of electrical energy that can damage and stun anyone within its area. Advanced arc emitters can be used at a longer range and are used by military forces to stun and subdue groups of enemies.

### SHOCK WEAPONS

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
