# NANITE NODE
Compartments inside the vehicle’s hull contain microscopic nanites capable of repairing critical damage to the vehicle. As a move action when the vehicle is broken, the nanite node can be activated to repair the vehicle’s most damaged systems. This instantaneously restores a number of Hit Points when activated, as well as at the beginning of each of the next two rounds, based on the modification’s model. The nanite node can’t restore Hit Points to a wrecked vehicle.
