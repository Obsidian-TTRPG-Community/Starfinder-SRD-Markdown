### Description

This oblong box the length of a human hand contains several hypoallergenic staples and a mass of sticky antiseptic gel. You use the dermal stapler by pressing it onto a willing or unconscious living creature’s wound the dermal stapler launches one of its staples into the wound to close it and slathers the staple with the antiseptic gel. You can use a dermal stapler on a willing or unconscious creature to automatically end the bleeding condition without a Medicine check. Alternatively, you can use it in conjunction with a medkit to treat deadly wounds and gain a +1 insight bonus to your Medicine check. In addition to consuming a charge with each use, a dermal stapler must synthesize new staples and gel after 20 uses, at a cost in UPBs equal to one-quarter the stapler’s price.
