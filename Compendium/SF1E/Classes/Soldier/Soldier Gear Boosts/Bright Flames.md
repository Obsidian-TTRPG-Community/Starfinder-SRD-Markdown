# Bright Flames 
(Ex; 3rd Level)
source: Tech Revolution pg. 33
Any weapon from the flame category gains the bright weapon special property while you wield it. If the weapon already has the bright property, the weapon’s attacks increase the area’s illumination by two steps, to a maximum of normal light. You can suppress or resume this gear boost for weapons you wield without spending an action.
