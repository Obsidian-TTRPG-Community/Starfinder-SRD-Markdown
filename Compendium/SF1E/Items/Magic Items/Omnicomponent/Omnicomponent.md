This strange object resembles a 6-inch-wide, dark, and pristinely polished wooden cube, though which run irregular seams of coppery metal. Omnicomponents are quite rare, defying attempts to manufacture them and instead typically appearing only on asteroids and other debris adrift in magical cosmic phenomena. By spending 1 hour holding and focusing on an omnicomponent, a spellcaster can transform it into a spell’s material component worth a maximum number of credits based on the object’s model. If not consumed as part of casting a spell within 8 hours, the omnicomponent reverts to its natural shape and can be coaxed into a different shape. Once used as a material component, it’s destroyed.
