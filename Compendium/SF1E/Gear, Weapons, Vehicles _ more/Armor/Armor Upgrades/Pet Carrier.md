# PET CARRIER
**Source** _Alien Archive 3 pg. 147_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 119_  
**Item Level** 1; **Price** 100

The pet carrier armor upgrade takes one upgrade slot and provides space for one Tiny, two Diminutive, or four Fine creatures to take refuge in your armor. You can open or close a pet carrier as a move action. A creature of appropriate size can enter or exit a pet carrier by using 5 feet of movement to do so. While inside the pet carrier, a creature benefits from total cover and your armor’s environmental protections, but it can’t take any physical actions other than to leave an open carrier.   
  
The bulk of the pet carrier is 1 when occupied.
