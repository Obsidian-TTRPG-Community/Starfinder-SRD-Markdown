## DESCRIPTION

The Hivonyx Ambassador is one of the company’s most iconic models, and with good reason: the starship exemplifies the manufacturer’s dedication to peace, cultural connection, and comfortable accommodations. As its name would suggest, the Ambassador is popular among diplomats, merchants, and anyone who wishes to travel the galaxy to speak with others rather than fight.  
  
The ship is specifically built to allow for diplomatic negotiations to take place on board; along with guest quarters and a sealed environmental chamber to allow for guests of many different species, each unit also has a meeting space.  
  
The Ambassador is outfitted with a moderate selection of weaponry (albeit with Hivonyx’s built-in firing restrictions), but it is certainly no battleship. Instead, it largely relies on its famous Hivonyx design—with brilliant colors and insectile features—to discourage hostilities from any but the most depraved outlaws. These elements provide an alien elegance of sleek lines and continuous contours that occasionally attract more belligerent crews and deadly retrofitting. Over the past several decades, Hivonyx has experimented with and ultimately discarded a host of customer screening protocols to prevent Ambassadors from falling into what they consider the wrong hands.  
  
The Ambassador was originally designed as a much higher-end model of starship, but many of Hivonyx’s governmental clients couldn’t justify the price. The starship went through a variety of models until it reached its production design. The model balances a level of comfort conducive to diplomatic negotiations with a price tag that fits within a government’s budget. Quite a few businesses also use Ambassadors when entering negotiations with other companies. This is the starship of choice for shirren CEOs on business. Hivonyx often designs an exclusive custom exterior for a specific customer buying a whole fleet, usually implementing national colors, company emblems, or other recognizable features. Given the number of highly sensitive conversations that occur on Ambassadors, the walls of the personal quarters and meeting rooms are often lined with materials that prevent transmissions to ensure privacy. Panels in the walls can be displaced to allow for teleconferences or simply for calling home.
