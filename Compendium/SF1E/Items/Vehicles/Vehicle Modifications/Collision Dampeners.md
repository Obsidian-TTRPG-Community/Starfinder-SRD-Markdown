# Collision Dampeners

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 81_
**Price** 9,100  
This modification utilizes gravitational and magnetic fields to reduce the damage taken by a vehicle in a collision. When the vehicle damages an enemy with a ram action, this vehicle deals only one quarter its collision damage to itself (rather than one half its collision damage). When the vehicle takes collision damage from any other effect, such as when crashing or being rammed, reduce the collision damage the vehicle takes by 1 per die of collision damage.
