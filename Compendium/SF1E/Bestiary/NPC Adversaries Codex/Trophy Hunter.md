# TROPHY HUNTER
Survivalists are defined by independence and self-sufficiency. They often expertly navigate specific types of hostile or dangerous terrain: forests, deserts, or more remote locales such as dead space or post-apocalyptic cityscapes. Survivalists generally don’t rely on others and commonly live and work alone. However, the following statistics can represent hunters and warriors within a community as well as hermits. A survivalist might have some kind of sentient companion or a creature companion, such as a beast of burden or a hunting beast. A survivalist might arrive at a critical moment to help PCs as they travel through a barren wasteland. Alternatively, a survivalist makes an excellent antagonist in a wilderness setting since they’re capable of using every aspect of the environment against their foes.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Selected Prey (Ex)** As a swift action, a trophy hunter can designate a creature they can see within 60 feet as their prey. This designation remains for a number of hours equal to the trophy hunter’s CR, until the marked prey dies, or until the trophy hunter designates another creature as their prey. A trophy hunter gains a bonus equal to half their CR to Survival checks to track their prey and to weapon damage rolls against their prey.

## DESCRIPTION

Trophy hunters seek to conquer the greatest prey they can track down. Some might hunt dangerous creatures to ensure the safety of others, and some are nothing more than glory hounds seeking thrill and prestige. Trophy hunters are sometimes accompanied by beasts they’ve captured and trained.
