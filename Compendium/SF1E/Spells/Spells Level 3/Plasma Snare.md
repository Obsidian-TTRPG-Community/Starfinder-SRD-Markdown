## Description

You conjure a volatile string of plasma and lash the target. Attempt a melee attack against the target's EAC. If you hit, the target takes 3d6 electricity and fire damage (critical knockdown) and is entangled (escape DC equals the spell's save DC + 4). Each time the target fails to escape, it takes 2d6 electricity and fire damage. If the target escapes, the plasma snare drops to the ground in that space—if the target ends its turn there, the target takes 1d6 electricity and fire damage.

If a turn ends with the plasma snare holding no creature entangled, the spell ends. As a reaction to the end of a turn (before the snare disappears) or the target escaping, provided you're within 30 feet of the snare, you can detonate the plasma snare, discharging the spell. If you do, the plasma explodes in a 10-foot radius. Creatures in the area take 4d6 electricity and fire damage and gain the burning (1d6) condition. Those who succeed at a Reflex saving throw take half as much damage and don't gain the burning condition. If the target is still entangled when the plasma detonates, the target takes a –6 penalty to this saving throw.

Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
