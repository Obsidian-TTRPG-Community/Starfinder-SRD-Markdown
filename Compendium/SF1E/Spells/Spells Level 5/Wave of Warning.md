## Description

Maraquoi spellcasters developed this spell to deter sapient aggressors from bloodshed. You thrust a wave of mental determination at up to three targets, attempting a ranged attack against each target's KAC to deal 10d8 nonlethal bludgeoning damage. Each creature damaged by this spell is shaken for 5 rounds, or 1 round if they succeed at a Will saving throw.
