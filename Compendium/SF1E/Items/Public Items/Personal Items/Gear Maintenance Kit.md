### Description

This kit contains tools to maintain most common equipment. It includes a canister of lubricating oil, several small drivers and wrenches, armor polish, an armor cleansing agent with a citrus aroma, and a UPB pen that can repair small cracks, dents, scuffs, and other signs of wear and tear in most types of gear. A UPB pen can hold 1 UPB, which is enough to repair cosmetic damage on any one item.
