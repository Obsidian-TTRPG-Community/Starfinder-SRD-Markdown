# Drift Engines

These engines let you travel to and from the Drift (see page 290). The better the engine rating, the faster you can reach distant destinations. Drift engines have a PCU requirement and a maximum frame size. The cost in Build Points is based on the starship’s size category (for the purposes of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, and so on). See the table below for the statistics of the various Drift engines.  
  
For a starship to engage its Drift engines to either enter or exit the Drift, its conventional thrusters must be turned off for 1 minute.
