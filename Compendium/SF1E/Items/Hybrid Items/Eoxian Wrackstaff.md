### Description

Consisting of a long metallic shaft capped with a two-pronged head, an _Eoxian wrackstaff_ is a two-handed basic melee weapon that deals 6d4 bludgeoning damage and has the block weapon special property. On a critical hit, the target is affected by _inflict pain_ (CL 13th). Undead creatures are immune to this critical hit effect.
