### DESCRIPTION

This single-use serum is designed to acclimate you to any non‑Drift plane besides the Material Plane. For 1 hour, you lose the extraplanar subtype and count as a native of the plane you’re currently on for the purpose of divination magic and how planar traits affect you. This has no effect in the Drift.
