## Description

At the Doyenate’s urging, Idari Crucible Works designed the Keris as a versatile and sustainable long-range fighter. The ship’s distinctive teardrop shape, downswept wings, and golden cockpit canopy combine familiar hallmarks of kasathan shipbuilding with the innovative features represented in Idari Crucible Works’ newer models. Unlike most craft of its size, the Keris’s cockpit contains seating and controls that allow the pilot and gunner to sit next to one another, rather than in tandem. Operators agree that the spacious design is a welcome alternative to the typical arrangement, and the roomy crew space is particularly prized for its comfort during long-distance missions.  
 
Though it incorporates cutting-edge Pact World technology into its design, the Keris is steeped in ancient kasathan tradition
the vessels that inspired its form served as escorts for colony ships long before Idari’s own journey. While examining ancient schematics, kasathan engineers realized they could resurrect the millennia-old design and enhance it with Pact Worlds technology, such as vastly improved thrusters, as well as with Drift functionality. Some traditionalists yearn to rediscover the alloys used in the original Kerises’ construction to incorporate into the manufacturing process. That this technology seems lost to the Gap hasn’t stopped wealthy patrons from funding expeditions to recover aging kasathan starship hulls for study.  
 
Today, these fighters frequently serve as long-range patrol vessels or as guardians for cruiser vanguards in military operations across Near Space. Fleet commanders treasure the Keris for its operational endurance and fuel efficiency, whereas their engineers prize the Keris’s easy maintenance routines. The starship’s hearty defensive specs seem to encourage risky behavior, however. One tactic popularized by Keris fighter pilots involves reinforcing the aft shields while positioning the craft between the ship they’re protecting and incoming projectiles. The gunner then opens fire on the hostile torpedoes using the craft’s aft-mounted weapon, hopefully destroying the projectiles before they can reach their target. This “reverse Keris” maneuver earns these pilots a perhaps undeserved reputation as foolhardy and reckless. Still, the bold tactic has saved more than a few ships from devastating bombardment, and Keris operators continue to favor and develop risky maneuvers in the heat of battle—somewhat contrary to kasathas’ love of tradition. It’s not uncommon for Keris crews to challenge passersby to friendly duels, trusting their starships’ shields to deflect harm while testing out innovative strategies on unfamiliar targets.
