### Description

Some melee weapons can be made to collapse for easy and inconspicuous storage. A weapon must be purchased or crafted with this accessory integrated. As a move action, you can fold or close a collapsing weapon into a much smaller size, allowing you to use the Sleight of Hand skill to hide a collapsed weapon of 1 or 2 bulk as if it were a light weapon, or granting a collapsed weapon of light bulk the conceal special property (see page 27). As a move action, you can re-extend a collapsed weapon.
