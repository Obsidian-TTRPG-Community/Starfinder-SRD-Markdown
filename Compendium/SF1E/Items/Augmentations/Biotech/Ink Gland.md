# Ink Gland

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 59_  
**Item Level** 4;
**Price**::  2,000; **System** Throat  
You produce and store organic ink in your throat that you can deploy as a defensive measure. When you’re in an aquatic environment, you can take a standard action to vomit ink, creating darkness in a 20-foot radius. Darkvision can’t see through this darkness, but effects capable of seeing through fog, mist, or clouds—such as thermal-sensitive eyes (below)—can. After you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina.
