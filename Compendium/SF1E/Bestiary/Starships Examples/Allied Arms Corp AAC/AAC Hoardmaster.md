## Description

A product of the Allied Arms Corporation (AAC) of Triaxus, the Hoardmaster is the flagship of the Skyfire Legion’s mercenary fleet. The aptly named carrier can launch over a dozen smaller craft into battle. Designed to operate in tandem with AAC Dyads, this specialized carrier has experienced a surge in popularity during the past 50 years.  
 
The echoes of the Swarm War, combined with the identification of other potential threats to the Pact Worlds, have created myriad opportunities for the Skyfire Legion’s iconic vessels to showcase their might. Most recently, a pair of Hoardmasters defended competing corporate mining interests in the Vast against Swarm reconnaissance teams. Their Dyad squads covered the emergency extraction of a Veskarium mining colony’s ground assets while simultaneously protecting nearby Pact Worlds transports as the Hoardmasters warmed up their Drift engines for the retreat to safety. Live vidstream coverage of the maneuver inspired a host of hopeful Skyfire recruits across Near Space, bringing new interplanetary relevancy to an already potent mercenary force.  
 
Though the Hoardmaster is slow, each carries a complement of up to 16 Dyads that can be launched at a moment’s notice via catapult tubes integrated throughout its hull. The Skyfire Legion encourages soldiers to maintain constant battle-readiness
to this end, all Skyfire Legion Hoardmasters incorporate state-of-the-art combat training facilities.  
 
As with Skyfire Legion Dyads, most Hoardmaster crews consist of bonded ryphorian-dragonkin pairs whose deep connection allows teamwork otherwise deemed practically impossible. Given the fleet of Dyads—and their pilots—often aboard a Hoardmaster, co-pilots of these massive carriers must be of the highest caliber, chosen only after lengthy training and testing periods. Piloting a Hoardmaster is considered a high honor among the members of the Skyfire Legion, and competition to even qualify for consideration is fierce among pilot pairs. In fact, more than a few duos have pulled foolhardy flying stunts in Dyads and played dangerous political games in an attempt to get noticed as potential Hoardmaster pilots.
