This wide-barreled cannon emits a stream of red-tinged energy that originates from the weapon’s heavy proton tank, affecting all enemies in a line. Like most disintegrator weapons, they are available in liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator models.

#### Disintegrator Weapons

Available as pistols (small arms), rifles (longarms), and cannons (heavy weapons), these powerful weapons are often referred to by the more scientific term “high-energy proton decouplers,” as they produce streams of energized fields that corrode and break down matter much like subatomic acid would. However, since their effects appear to turn metal to slag, plastic to vapor, and flesh to goo, they’re commonly known as “disintegrators.” Devourer cultists particular revere disintegrators because the weapons slough away their enemies’ flesh.
