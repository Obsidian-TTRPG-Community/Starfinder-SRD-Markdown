### DESCRIPTION

The innovative ysoki created this reinforced jumpsuit layered with energy-reflective foil. This light armor is undeniably noticeable, but it also protects against energy attacks with the same efficacy as it does kinetic attacks. Ysoki refractor suits are popular among all races now and can be tinted in different metallic shades.
