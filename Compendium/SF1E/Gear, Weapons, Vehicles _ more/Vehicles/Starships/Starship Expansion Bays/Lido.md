## LIDO

**Source** _Ports of Call pg. 28_  
**PCU** 2; **Cost (in BP)** 10  
This ship area features lawns, pools, and other traditional outdoor recreational facilities and sometimes has exterior views through a transparent forcefield or dome. A lido is designed to maximize relaxation with calming music, simulated sunlight, and other factors to recharge guests and crew. Luxury liners often include a lido, but they can be found on smaller ships as well. You can use a lido for 4 hours before using the carouse downtime activity (Character Operations Manual 151); this reduces the cumulative penalty to the saving throw for carousing repeatedly by 2.
