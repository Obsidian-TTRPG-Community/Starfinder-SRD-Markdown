specialabil:
  - name: "Anachronistic Strike (Su)"
    desc: "Any damage an epokasite deals with an archaic weapon is never reduced as a result of that property. Any archaic weapon an epokasite wields typically deals additional damage or has additional weapon properties, equivalent to a basic melee weapon or small arm of a level equal to the fey’s CR."
  - name: Draining Aura(Su)
    desc: "An epokasite fixer radiates an aura that drains active technological items. While in the area, each item whose level is no more than twice the fixer’s CR (level 7 for most fixers) doubles its usage (if it uses charges to function), reduces the saving throw DCs of any effects it creates by 2, and increases the DC of all checks to use the item by 2. If the item’s level is lower than the fixer’s CR, it instead triples its usage, reduces its saving throw DCs by 3, and increases the check DCs by 3."
  - name: "Regressing Glare (Su)"
    desc: "As a standard action, an epokasite runner can focus their gaze on a technological or hybrid item within 30 feet whose level doesn’t exceed the runner’s level + 2. Unless it succeeds at a DC 18 fortitude save, the item transforms into an anachronistic analogue of itself, such as a rifle turning into a musket or steamoperated crossbow. This transformation lasts for 1d6+2 rounds, during which time the item gains the archaic property, functions as if it had the broken condition, and any checks made to manipulate the item (such as operating a now-antiquated computer) take a –2 penalty. If the target is a weapon or armor that fails the save by 5 or more, it changes so dramatically that any user is treated as not proficient with the item. The runner can affect items of size Large or smaller with this ability, including terminals and vehicles. Once an item has saved against this ability, it’s immune to that runner’s regressing glare for 24 hours. An epokasite ignores all of a regressed item’s drawbacks listed above when using the item."
  - name: "Tech Resistance (Su)"
    desc: "An epokasite naturally resists contemporary technology, including technological traps, most weapons, technomancer spells, hybrid gear, and the natural attacks of creatures with the technological subtype. Any damage the epokasite takes from such sources is reduced by the listed amount (minimum 0), which doesn’t stack with other [[Energy Resistance]] the epokasite has. Natural hazards, weapons with the archaic special weapon property, and other forms of magic bypass this defense."

## Runner Cr 8

Epokasites fixate on specific technological and cultural eras, believing them the purest expression of a culture and, by extension, nature itself. Where new developments interfere with this ideal, epokasites try to preserve historic machinery, even sabotaging new technologies in a stubborn defense of the old ways.
Epokasites take two common forms: fixers and runners. Fixers rarely stand at more than a foot tall, whereas runners exceed heights of 5 feet. Sensory papillae cover their noses, helping the fey detect a variety of stimuli, which they normally use to locate technology from their favored time period, such as hints of forge charcoal, motor oil on a combustion engine, or the tang of early lasers. Each epokasite adopts slang, clothing, and gear appropriate to their favored era, from chainmail, hides, outdated suits, or alchemists’ coveralls.
Being shy creatures, fixers prefer to operate out of sight. Runners instead thrive on infiltrating the modern societies they so disdain, donning disguises and stealing credentials to access delicate technologies. Both epokasite varieties regularly sneak onto starships or into sensitive facilities as stowaways in the guise of hired hands, largely so that they can sabotage the technological affronts to their favored eras—acts they consider entirely helpful and for which they expect a reward from any who discover them in action. Rarely, epokasites might live openly among a community, most often in groups of stubborn luddites, historical reenactors, or closely-aligned cosplayers. In those settings, they might act as excitable consultants and crafters.
An epokasite most often imprints on the culture and time period in which they came into existence on the Material Plane. Less often, an epokasite might wander until they read about or experience an era that impresses them, thereafter adopting that period as their focus.
The most tragic and contentious of all epokasites are those who embody eras now lost to the Gap. These distraught individuals rarely maintain more than a memento or faint memory from that lost time, and they strive to piece together whatever they can, sometimes teaming up with Starfinders and other scholars.
