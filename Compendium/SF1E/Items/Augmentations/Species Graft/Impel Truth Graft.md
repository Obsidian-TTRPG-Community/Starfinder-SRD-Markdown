# Impel Truth Graft

**Level**:: 6
**Price**::  4000 
**System**:: Brain  
Many sazarons have developed a magical way to deal with their cohabitants—tale-spinning dirindi fabulists—in order to reach the truth of certain matters. A psychic implant in your brain grants you the ability to cast zone of truth once per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level of this effect is equal to your character level.
