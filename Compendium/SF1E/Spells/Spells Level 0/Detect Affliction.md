## Description

You determine whether a creature or object has been poisoned, is diseased, is cursed, or is suffering a similar affliction. If the target is poisoned or diseased, you automatically detect that fact and can determine the exact type of poison or disease with a successful DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check. If you are trained in Life Science or Medicine (depending on the nature of the poison or disease), you can attempt a DC 20 check of that skill if you fail your Wisdom or Intelligence check. If the target is cursed or suffering from a similar affliction, you must succeed at a DC 20 Intelligence or Wisdom check to determine that fact. You can then determine the exact nature of the curse with a successful DC 25 Mysticism check.
