# ENTROPY GLOVES
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 122_  
**Level** 9; **Price** 13,000; **Bulk** L

### DESCRIPTION

These dark gloves have silver claws and a clear hemisphere embedded on the back of the hand that contains a writhing ball of negative energy. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.  
  
Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use _entropic grasp_ as a spell-like ability (save DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier; caster level 9th). If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of _entropy gloves_, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.
