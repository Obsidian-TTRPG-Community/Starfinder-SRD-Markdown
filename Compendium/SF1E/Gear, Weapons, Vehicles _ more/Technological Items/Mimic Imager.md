# MIMIC IMAGER

A mimic imager functions as both an image scanner and a holographic projector.  

##  MIMIC IMAGER, HELMET-MOUNTED

**Capacity** 40; **Usage** 4/round

### DESCRIPTION

The most common mimic imagers are mounted to a helmet on a swiveling, telescoping rod. When you activate the mimic imager, it takes 1 round to circle you and scan your current appearance. The round after you activate the mimic imager, it creates a holographic duplicate of you in a square (or squares, if you are a Large creature) within 20 feet that you designate. This hologram includes minor sounds but not understandable speech. The hologram then mimics your actual movements (walking forward as you walk forward, raising a gun as you do, and so on) while maintaining the same distance from you. You must always remain within 20 feet of the image and maintain line of sight to it, or the image winks out with a flash of static. Detecting the duplicate as being a hologram requires a move action and a successful DC 20 Perception check. If you deactivate the mimic imager or it runs out of charges, the mimic imager must rescan you the next time it is activated.

##  MIMIC IMAGER, HOVERING

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 105_  
**Level** 11; **Price** 24,500  
**Capacity** 40; **Usage** 4/round  
**Hands** —; **Bulk** L

### DESCRIPTION

A hovering mimic imager is a 2-inch-wide spherical microbot with more sophisticated imaging software and data on your movements, speech, and mannerisms. The hovering mimic imager operates as the helmet-mounted version, except that the hologram created by the hovering mimic imager can also mimic speech in your voice, and the DC of Perception checks to identify the hologram is 30. As the hovering mimic imager isn’t attached to you, the image can be up to 100 feet from you and doesn’t require line of sight to you (although it must be within 20 feet of and have line of sight to the microbot). The hovering mimic imager can receive your directions by voice or via a signal from a personal comm unit or a datapad with a control module installed. The hovering mimic imager has sound baffling and a light-shifting shell to avoid detection, but a creature can notice it with a successful DC 25 Perception check. Detecting the microbot doesn’t automatically reveal that your duplicate is a hologram, but its presence can provide creatures a clue that something unusual is going on. The hovering mimic imager is a Tiny technological construct with an AC of 20, hardness 8, 10 Hit Points, and a fly speed of 40 feet with perfect maneuverability. It cannot make attacks, and it fails any saving throw it is required to make. When the mimic imager has only 4 charges remaining, the hologram winks out and the hovering mimic imager immediately returns to you if it can. Your communication with a hovering mimic imager uses a wireless signal, and is therefore vulnerable to countermeasures such as signal jammers.
