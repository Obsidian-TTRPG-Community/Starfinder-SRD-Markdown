### DESCRIPTION

These practical boots have integrated sensors that, when activated, track your footsteps and use that data to create a crude, three-dimensional map of where you move while using your land speed. This data is automatically uploaded to a designated comm unit within 30 feet. Periodically reviewing this map provides you a +1 circumstance bonus to checks to find hidden doors, passages, and other concealed architecture in the traversed area, as well as a +2 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to avoid getting lost.  
Variants of these boots exist for other movement types, such as wing-mounted sensors for flight or a lightweight tail harness for swim speeds.
