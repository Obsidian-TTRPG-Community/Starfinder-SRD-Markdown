# WITHERED LUNGS
**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 73_  
**System** Lungs  
These scarred, shriveled lungs allow you to breathe normally, yet they especially thrive when exposed to harmful airborne effect, such as smoke or an inhaled affliction. As a move action while in the area of an airborne hazard, you can inhale deeply, eliminating the airborne hazard from your space as well as from a number of contiguous 5-foot cubes equal to twice the augmentation’s model. Doing so exposes you to the hazard, though you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to any saving throw to resist initial exposure to the hazard. Upon absorbing a hazard in this way, the lungs process the material into vital energy, and you regain a number of Stamina Points equal to twice the hazard’s CR, twice the level of the item that created the hazard, or twice the CR of the creature that created the effect. Once you inhale a hazard in this way, you cannot do so again until you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.
