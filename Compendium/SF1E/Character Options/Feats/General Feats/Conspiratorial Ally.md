Benefit: After a creature discusses their beliefs or guiding philosophy with you, or if they’re displaying a prominent symbol that would indicate their beliefs (such as a holy symbol), you can attempt a Culture check to recall knowledge (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the creature’s CR). On a success, you know what the creature cares deeply about and how to use that to your advantage. For the next minute, while you are using this knowledge, you can treat the creature’s attitude toward you as one step higher.
