# BATTLEFLOWER MASTER
Across the universe, sapient species have independently discovered the societal benefits of friendly (and not-so-friendly) competitionâ€”as well as the fame and fortune that can be made by widely broadcasting such competitions to die-hard fans. While some cultures thrive on intellectual games of skill and strategy, others revel in fast-paced displays of martial might, brute strength, or deadly struggle. No matter the culture, those who succeed in these displays of wit and brawn can amass quite a bit of wealth, cultural clout, and even interplanetary notoriety.  
Sports figures are direct and to-the-point combatants with a focus on physicality, dexterity, or brute force, and they can easily serve in any role where violence is a means to an end. Re-skinned sports figures might serve as flashy mercenaries, daring pirates, specially trained guards, or hired muscle.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Working the Crowd (Ex)** While a battleflower master is fighting in front of two or more noncombatants, whenever they successfully grapple an opponent or hit an opponent with a weapon with the Profession (dancer) weapon special property, they can attempt a Profession (dancer) check with the same DC as a check to demoralize that enemy (as the Intimidate skill) as a swift action. If the grapple attempt or attack roll is a natural 20, the battleflower master can roll twice on the demoralize attempt and take the higher roll. This is an emotion and fear effect.
