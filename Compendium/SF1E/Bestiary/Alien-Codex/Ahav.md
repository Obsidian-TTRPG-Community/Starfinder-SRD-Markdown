**Organization** solitary or unit (1 AHAV plus 10-12 soldiers)

### Special Abilities

**MODEL (Ex)** An AHAV is created with one of the Mission Dependent Loadouts, or MODELs, listed below. MODELs are intended to allow AHAVs to serve in a variety of roles. This list is not exhaustive; the GM is free to design other MODELs at her discretion.

_Advanced Maneuverability_: The AHAV has an extraordinary fly speed of 60 feet (perfect maneuverability) and the Spring Attack feat.  
_Autoloader_: When the AHAV makes a full attack with its medium machine gun, it can make up to three attacks instead of two attacks. It takes a –5 penalty to these attacks instead of a –4 penalty.  
_Camouflage Plating_: The AHAV gains a +20 enhancement bonus to Stealth checks.  
_Harrying Arms_: The AHAV has numerous pistols or other small arms mounted to its chassis. As a full action, the AHAV automatically succeeds at the harrying fire action against every enemy within 60 feet.  
_Ram_: The AHAV gains a slam attack with a +23 attack bonus that deals 6d4+17 bludgeoning damage. If the AHAV hits with this attack after a charge, the target is also knocked back 30 feet. If the target is blocked from moving the full distance, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet it can’t move.

**Sensor Suite (Ex)** As a full action, an AHAV can gain one of the following benefits for 1 minute: blindsight (life), blindsight (vibration), sense through (vision), or a +10 enhancement bonus to Perception checks. It can change which benefit it receives as a full action. At the GM’s discretion, an AHAV might have access to more options, such as blindsight (emotion) or blindsight (thought).

## Description

Military marvels of advanced weaponry and artificial-personality programming, AHAVs are ruthless machines of war, bound by their programming to follow their objectives without pause. The acronym AHAV stands for “autonomous heavy assault vehicle,” reflecting the constructs’ ability to operate independently and make basic decisions on the battlefield. While the term originated with a specific and popular early model produced by Ironfire Industries on Absalom Station shortly after the Gap, the name quickly spread in colloquial use to refer to all robotic war machines of similar designs, and these days many corporations on many different worlds use the term to market their own proprietary models. AHAVs are built to appear intimidating: sturdy armor-plated tanks that float on hovertreads, armed with various heavy weapons and bristling with antennae. AHAVs have a full complement of sensors, capable of detecting heat, vibration, and sometimes other signatures, though they don’t usually have enough processing power to activate every available sense at once.

AHAVs are expensive and difficult to construct, so relatively few of them are found in the service of small planetary militaries and mercenary groups. Only the richest of worlds (and collectors interested in ensuring the safety of their private collections) can afford to purchase and maintain even a single AHAV.

Unfortunately, since AHAVs’ basic programming leaves little room for independent thought and nuance, many of them can be easily tricked by those who can figure out the literal outlines of their objectives and work around them. As such, AHAVs have dropped off in popularity over the past few decades, though the corporations invested in building them are continually working to improve on this limitation.

Before they are programmed, AHAVs are outfitted with Mission Dependent Loadouts (MODELs for short), which are special abilities and equipment that aid a robot in its particular mission. An AHAV focused on reconnaissance might have an advanced sensor suite or stealth capabilities, while one intended to go head to head with a superior enemy force might have augmented weaponry. A sufficiently astute observer can use the MODEL of an AHAV to puzzle out its objective.

AHAVs are built to last—a feature that sometimes means their objectives fail before they do. For instance, an AHAV programmed to guard a particular site will continue to do so even though its handlers have long since perished. While such a construct might seem to be a sad sight, it pales in comparison to those AHAVs whose objectives have become unachievable or internally inconsistent over time. Such a state introduces subtle errors into the AHAV’s programming, which can result in behavior that would be called insane if exhibited by a flesh-and-blood creature. A technician who can uncover that robot’s original purpose might be able to speak with the machine, convincing it of the error of its ways or the irrationality of its objective, but AHAVs have an inherently confrontational worldview and are difficult to reason with. AHAVs that successfully confront such a misalignment are most likely to shut down entirely, becoming nothing but inert metal and circuitry.
