# PLASMA DIVERTER

**Source** _Alien Archive 2 pg. 101_  
**Level** 6; **Price** 4,300

### DESCRIPTION

This bandolier emits a low, crackling hum when activated. Whenever an attack from a plasma weapon hits the plasma diverter’s user, half of the electricity and half the fire damage (maximum 5 points of each) is prevented and instead restores a number of charges equal to the damage prevented to the plasma diverter’s battery. If this would restore more charges than the battery can hold, the battery must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude saving throw or be destroyed, dealing 1d6 damage to the plasma diverter per excess charge.  
  
A plasma diverter uses a super-capacity battery, and each minute of use (or fraction thereof) consumes 10 charges.
