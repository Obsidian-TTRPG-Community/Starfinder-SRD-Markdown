# NECROMANTIC REVITALIZATION

**Source** _Pact Worlds pg. 206_  
**Classes** Mystic 1-6, Technomancer 1-6  
**School** necromancy  
**Casting Time** 1 standard action  
**Range** touch  
**Targets** one undead creature  
**Duration** instantaneous  
**Saving Throw** Will half (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

## DESCRIPTION

With a touch, you replenish the negative energies that animate your target, restoring a number of Hit Points. If the target regains all of its Hit Points as a result of this healing, you can apply the remaining healing to yourself, as long as you are an undead creature.

_Necromantic revitalization_ restores a number of Hit Points to your target depending on the spell’s level.

**1st**: 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier  
**2nd**: 3d8 + your Intelligence modifier  
**3rd**: 5d8 + your Intelligence modifier  
**4th**: 7d8 + your Intelligence modifier  
**5th**: 9d8 + your Intelligence modifier  
**6th**: 11d8 + your Intelligence modifier

In addition, unlike with most healing, when you cast _necromantic revitalization_ as a spell of 4th level or higher, you have two options to enhance its effects. The first option is to restore an extra 5d8 Hit Points with a 4th-level necromantic _revitalization spell_, an extra 7d8 Hit Points with a 5th-level _necromantic revitalization_ spell, or an extra 9d8 Hit Points with a 6th-level _necromantic revitalization_ spell. The second option is to restore a target that was destroyed within the past 2 rounds, bringing it back to its undead state with the number of Hit Points that would otherwise be restored by this spell. This spell can’t reanimate creatures that were destroyed by effects that specifically target or have a special effect against the undead (such as _wall of fire_) or creatures whose bodies were significantly mutilated, disintegrated, or otherwise obliterated. It also cannot restore an undead creature whose existence is tied to an object (such as a necrovite’s electroencephalon) if that object has been destroyed.

Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
