This set of golden armor plating bears runes symbolizing death, life, and protection. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. As a move action, you can gain protection against certain necromantic attacks, per _death ward_, until you spend another move action to deactivate the upgrade or it runs out of charges. A _life shield’s_ charges replenish each day.
