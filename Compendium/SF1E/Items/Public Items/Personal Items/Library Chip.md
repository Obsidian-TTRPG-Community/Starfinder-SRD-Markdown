### Description

Widely used by the Arcanamirium, the Starfinder Society, and other scholarly organizations, library chips are portable storage devices that contain a digital library of information on a particular subject (Culture, Engineering, Life Science, Mysticism, or Physical Science). You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to skill checks to recall knowledge with that skill when using a library chip in conjunction with a tier-0 computer (such as a comm unit) or better. A library chip counts as a downloaded data set for the purposes of using the skill that the library chip pertains to. While using a library chip, you can attempt untrained skill checks to recall knowledge on that subject if the DC is 20 or less.
