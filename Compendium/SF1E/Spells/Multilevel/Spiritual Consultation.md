## DESCRIPTION

You draw a spirit into a comm unit or computer, allowing you to consult the spirit for information. As a swift action, you can ask the spirit a question; you can ask a question in this way a number of times equal to your key ability score modifier. The spirit attempts to recall knowledge with any of its available skills, then transmits a response to your question via the device at the start of your next turn. Questions asked of a spirit are wasted if they aren’t relevant to its field of expertise or aren’t achievable with skill checks to recall knowledge.
