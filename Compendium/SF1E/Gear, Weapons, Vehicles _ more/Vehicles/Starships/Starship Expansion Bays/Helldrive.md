Just as the Church of Iomedae made early use of proprietary _archon drives_, so too did Asmodeans develop their own technology: _Helldrives_, which enable starships to travel through Hell itself to circumvent Material Plane distances. Today, _Helldrives_ are most commonly found in the fleets of the Hellknights, supporting their mission to bring the rule of law to a chaotic universe.  
Hell is a brutal and orderly plane; it is full of dangers for the unwary, but it honors its agreements. Each _Helldrive_ functions as a physical contract permitting relatively easy—though rarely truly safe—passage through Hell. The Church of Asmodeus constructs each _Helldrive_ individually, customized for the ship that will carry it, and only those who follow the strict tenets of Hell to the letter are allowed to use them. _Helldrives_ run on fuel condensed from damned souls, and some planar scientists speculate that the very act of operating a _Helldrive_ is akin to signing an infernal contract, with the user’s soul pledged to become fuel for the next generation of _Helldrives_.
