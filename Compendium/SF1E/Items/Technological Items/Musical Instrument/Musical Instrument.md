# Musical Instrument

Musical instruments are popular throughout the galaxy and come in a dizzying array of styles, such as autohorns, electropaizo synth keyboards, monofilament guitars, and psychoactive wave plates. All but the most traditional and classical instruments use modern technology to amplify their sound, provide musical accompaniment, or connect wirelessly to other instruments in a band or orchestra.
