# Moonlight Fibers

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 96_  
**System** Spinal column  
Moonlight fibers augment the interface between brain and muscles, letting you briefly act with alacrity. As a swift action, you can act as though under the influence of the haste spell until the beginning of your next turn. As a reaction, you can use your necrograft to reroll a failed Reflex saving throw. After either use of your moonlight fibers, you are staggered for 1 round. You can use your moonlight fibers a number of times per day equal to the necrograft’s mark.
