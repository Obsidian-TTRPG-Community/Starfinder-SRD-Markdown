# Countermeasure - Fake Shell

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 215_
**Price** 50% of computer's base price + 10% of price of control and data modules; **Type** Countermeasure
This particularly cunning countermeasure creates an entirely fake network and system directory for anyone accessing the system that fails to bypass this countermeasure. The phony network has cloned control modules and data modules to make it appear to be the actual system, but the control modules do not actually work and the data modules contain garbage files. A character can uncover this ruse with a successful Computers check with a DC equal to the systemâ€™s DC + 5. See Detect Fake Shell on page 138 for more information. The fake shell countermeasure costs 50% of the base price of the computer plus 10% of the price of its control and data modules.
