# OBLITERATION
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 12_  
Your nanites mercilessly tear apart your enemies, whether by guiding your strikes to inflict severe damage or exploding from your attacks to simultaneously hurt multiple foes.

## UNSTOPPABLE NANITES (EX)1ST LEVEL

Weapons you form with your gear array gain the penetrating and boost 1d4 special properties. To use the boost property with a weapon that doesn’t have charges, you must use one nanite surge instead of expending additional charges. At 5th level, the boost special property increases to 1d6, and it increases by an additional 1d6 at 9th, 13th, and 17th levels.

## ENERGIZED SWARM (EX)5TH LEVEL

While wielding a weapon you formed with your gear array, you can take a swift action to change half or all the weapon’s damage type to cold, electricity, or fire until the beginning of your next turn. If the weapon already has two damage types, choose one to replace. This ability doesn’t cause a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC.

## SPREADING SWARM (EX)9TH LEVEL

The first time on your turn that you hit with a weapon formed with your gear array, you can deal that weapon’s minimum damage to a different target creature within 10 feet of the original target. The second creature can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. For example, a weapon that deals 6d8 damage would deal 6 damage to the secondary target with this effect.

## FLASHING NANITES (EX)13TH LEVEL

When making a full attack entirely with weapons formed from your gear array, you take a –3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal –4 penalty.

## MICROSCOPIC BOMBARDMENT (EX)17TH LEVEL

Your spreading swarm ability’s secondary target can be up to 20 feet away from your initial target. In addition, you can use a nanite surge before performing a full attack to apply your spreading swarm ability to both attacks.
