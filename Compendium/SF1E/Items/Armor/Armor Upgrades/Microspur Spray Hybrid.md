Eoxian corporations excel at technologies that use unliving materials, and the needle-sized self-replicating bone spurs in this upgrade are no exception. You can activate this upgrade as a standard action to launch microspurs in a 20-foot spread around you. All creatures in this area are affected by harrying fire. A microspur spray’s charges replenish each day.
