# Settlement Toolbox

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 150_  
From small towns to bustling metropolises to orbiting space stations, settlements comprise one of the major building blocks that make up a campaign setting. Every settlement should feel unique, whether due to geography, culture, or the quirks and challenges presented here.  
When creating a settlement from scratch, GMs can use the following tables to help give a particular settlement a touch of personality. Alternatively, a player can use these tables to determine something interesting about where their character is from.  
**Settlement Quirks:** These details help a settlement stand out.  
**Settlement Challenges:** These plot hooks might determine why the PCs visit a particular settlement, or they might spur adventure while the PCs are there.  
**Settlement Locations:** These locations might appear in any settlement. If you want a location in a low-technology settlement, reroll results of 51 or higher. If you want a location in a medium-technology settlement, reroll results of 81 or higher.
