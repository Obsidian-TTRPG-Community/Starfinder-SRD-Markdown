# ACID LANCER
In addition to collecting the valuable composites the creature leaves behind, some entrepreneurs enter surnochsâ€™ territory to hunt and kill them for their acid-producing glands and spines. These components can be made into heavy weapons known as acid lancers, which shoot jets of caustic fluid. A wielder of an acid lancer can squeeze the gland located near the trigger to give her next shot an extra boost of damaging acid. Acid lancers use a special synthetic acid called caustrol for ammunition, which has the same price and comes in the same size containers as petrol.
