The storm is difficult terrain and obscures all sight beyond 5 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of an attacker while in the storm have concealment. When the apastra uses solar storm, it can maintain the storm for up to an additional 1d3 rounds. An apastra must take a full action each round to maintain the storm, and it can move the storm up to 30 feet as part of that full action. An apastra is immune to the effects of its own or any other apastra’s solar storm."

## Equinoxian Apastra Cr 15

Equinoxians are rare and unusual native outsiders who simultaneously embody the power of both black holes and blazing suns. Alternating waves of photons and gravitons constantly travel along their roughly humanoid‑shaped bodies. An equinoxian’s head and legs might shine with light while its torso and arms remain as black as the void, and a few seconds later, the opposite may be true, as waves of energy ripple through the equinoxian’s body. As equinoxians age and their connection to the Cycle grows, they must learn to master the perfect balance of the contradictory powers within themselves, lest they lose control of those forces.
Equinoxian periastras are masters of the Cycle, perpetually balancing the gravitonic and photonic forces comprising their bodies, and they are legendary for their fighting prowess. They oppose forces of chaos and guard sites holy to solarians, allowing visitors to enter only after they have proven their mastery of the Cycle in combat.
Those equinoxians who cannot maintain balance are driven mad, becoming the tragic and powerful figures known as apastras. Apastras seek to cause imbalance and collapse wherever they can, and solarians justly fear the enraged creatures.
