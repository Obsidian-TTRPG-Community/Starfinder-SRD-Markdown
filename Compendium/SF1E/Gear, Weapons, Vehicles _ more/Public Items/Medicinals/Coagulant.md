A coagulant thickens the blood, serving as an emergency stopgap to prevent someone from bleeding out before receiving medical attention. When you take or are injected with a coagulant, you gain immunity to the bleeding condition for 1 minute per tier of the medicinal, but you also take a penalty equal to the medicinalâ€™s tier to Acrobatics and Athletics checks and to Reflex saves for that duration.
