### Description

Stone statuettes representing ancestors feature regularly in traditional maraquoi spirituality, serving as a conduit for deceased family to commune with the living. Some maraquoi have put a new twist on this tradition by creating drones to represent the ancestors instead. An ancestor drone is a Tiny, maraquoi-shaped domestic drone (Armory 101) that functions as the hover drone of a 1st-level mechanic with no drone mods. The drone features a small display screen in its chest, typically showing a curated array of short videos and images of several ancestors. Once per day, you can ritually pose a question to the ancestor drone, which channels fragmented wisdom from your departed family to answer you; this functions as augury but doesn’t require spending Resolve Points.
