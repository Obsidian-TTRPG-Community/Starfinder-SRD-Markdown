# NOVA RIFLE

Much like traditional plasma rifles, nova rifles fire coherent gouts of plasma that can potentially travel some distance and burn multiple targets. However, nova rifles have a slimmer profile overall but a larger aperture, projecting plasma that’s both slightly cooler and more diffuse. The nova rifle’s intense visual display makes it a favorite of icons looking to make a statement or simply add pyrotechnics to their shows. Red star, yellow star, and white star nova rifles are all easily identified by the color of their plasma arcs.

### PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
