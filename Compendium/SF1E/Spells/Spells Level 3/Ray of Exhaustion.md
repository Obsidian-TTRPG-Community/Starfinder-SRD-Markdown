## Description

You create an enervating ray of magic. You must make a ranged attack against your opponent’s EAC. On a hit, the target is immediately exhausted for the spell’s duration. A creature that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw is only fatigued, unless it is already fatigued, in which case it instead becomes exhausted despite the saving throw.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already exhausted. Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell’s duration expires.
