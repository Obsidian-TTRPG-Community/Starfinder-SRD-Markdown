# Antigravity Grenade

These explosives create temporary fields of reduced gravity, upending foes, helping move large objects, and enabling extraordinary acrobatic feats. Each grenade reduces the area’s gravity strength (Core Rulebook 401–402) by a number of steps based on the grenade’s model: extreme gravity to high gravity to standard gravity to low gravity to microgravity (effectively zero gravity with some exceptions, listed below). The grenade has no effect in zero gravity conditions; it cannot reduce gravity to less than microgravity conditions, and the effects of multiple antigravity grenades are not cumulative.  
Ranged attacks made through a microgravity area ignore any affected squares they pass through for the purpose of calculating their penalty to attack due to range increment. Such attacks traveling through low gravity or high gravity areas respectively count every third affected square or count each affected square three times when calculating the attack’s penalty due to range.  
The first time a creature enters or starts its turn in an area of microgravity, it can attempt a Reflex save. If successful, it automatically gains its bearings enough to fly, can move at half speed along any surface on which it was already standing, can take guarded steps, and can move along that surface as though the surface had sufficient handholds (or gains a +5 bonus to Acrobatics and Athletics checks to navigate the surface if it already had such handholds). If it fails the save, it is affected by zero gravity conditions normally and becomes off-kilter.
