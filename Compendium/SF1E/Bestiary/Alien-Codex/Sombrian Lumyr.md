## Lumyr Cr 8

When celestial bodies align, the cosmic fabric between the Material Plane and the First World sometimes thins, especially when combined with the emotional energy of the mortal fears and myths of those celestial bodies’ populaces. These ideal astronomical and psychological conditions often birth a sombrian, a fey creature imbued with either the blazing energy of a star or the eerie light of a blood moon.
Those born from a lunar eclipse are called lumyrs, while those born from a solar eclipse are called solmyrs. Both tend to resemble an intelligent species native to the system that birthed them. Most lumyrs have wings and other features reminiscent of nocturnal flying insects. However, their most unsettling feature is their apparent lack of internal organs
their mouths open into lightless voids, their wounds bleed only brief spatters of light, and their bodies are hollow, organ-less shells. Solmyrs’ eyes blaze like raging infernos and blinding light lines their bodies.
While lumyrs are insatiably curious and hedonistic, solmyrs are more reclusive and less focused on the ephemeral amusements of their kin. Many mythologies purport that each solmyr is granted a piece of prophecy upon their creation, most often a portent or warning about their star system of origin.
