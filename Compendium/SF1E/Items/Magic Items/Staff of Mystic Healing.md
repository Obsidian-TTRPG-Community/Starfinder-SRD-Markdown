### Description

Available in a variety of shapes and sizes, a _staff of mystic healing_ usually takes the form of an archaic shepherd’s crook, carved with pre-Gap runes of origin denoting prosperity and long life. If you have the healing touch class feature, you can use that ability one additional time per day while holding the staff. You cannot use more than one _staff of mystic healing_ each day to gain more than one additional use of healing touch, and a _staff of mystic healing_ works only once per day.
