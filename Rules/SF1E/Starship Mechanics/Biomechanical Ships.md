# Biomechanical Ships

The ships of the Xenowardens are not so much constructed as they are grown in orbital nurseries. Unique blends of technology and nature, they’re capable of healing themselves over time and responding to threats in ways unlike any other vessel. These abilities cannot be added to other vessels and, as of yet, no one else in the Pact Worlds has managed to unlock the secrets of their creation.  
  
**Empathetic Response**: A biomechanical ship can respond like a sentient creature when wounded or in danger. Once a biomechanical ship has taken critical damage, its speed increases by 2 hexes (which may affect its Piloting modifier; see page 319 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook). In addition, if the pilot of a biomechanical ship successfully performs the evade stunt, the ship receives a +3 circumstance bonus to its AC and TL (instead of +2).  
  
**Radiation Sensitive**: Weapons with the irradiate property deal tremendous damage to a biomechanical ship. In addition to the radiation damage dealt to the crew, the ship takes critical damage effects, depending on the level of the radiation. If the radiation level is low, the ship takes one critical damage effect. The ship takes two critical damage effects from medium radiation, and the ship takes four critical damage effects from high radiation.  
  
**Self-Repair**: While not traveling or in combat, a biomechanical vessel automatically regains 1 Hull Point per hour. This can be increased to 2 Hull Points per hour if the ship’s regrowth is being tended by someone with a number of ranks in the Engineering skill equal to the ship’s tier; that engineer can do nothing else during this time. The vessel requires the light from a nearby star, and therefore the ship must be in the same solar system as a star. Less light will delay or even halt this process (subject to the GM’s discretion). If this healing raises the ship’s HP over a multiple of its Critical Threshold, the critical damage condition of one randomly determined system is reduced by one step.
