### Description

A living creature who imbibes this serum develops a noticeable greenish tint to their skin, sometimes accompanied by temporary, leaflike protrusions. For the next week, the creature no longer requires food and gains the photosynthesis ability of a ghoran (Alien Archive 2 57). For the duration of this effect, the creature is affected by spells and abilities as though they possess the plant type graft (Alien Archive 133).
