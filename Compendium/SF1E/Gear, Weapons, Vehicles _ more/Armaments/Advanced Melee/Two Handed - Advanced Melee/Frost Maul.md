A two-handed hammer with a reservoir of coolant in its head, a frost maul simultaneously bludgeons and chills its target. As most substances become brittle and prone to shattering when subjected to extremely low temperatures, the frost maul excels at damaging objects it hits. Frost mauls come in aufeis, iceberg, floe, and glacier models.

# CRYO WEAPONS

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
