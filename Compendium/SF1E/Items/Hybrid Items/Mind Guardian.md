### Description

The microcircuitry contained within this adamantine ring records and magically reinforces your core personality. Once per day when you first come under the control of a mind-affecting effect, such as _charm monster_ or _dominate person_, you can act normally for the first round of the effect, after which you are staggered for 1d4 rounds and affected by the mind-affecting effect as normal.  
  
You must wear a _mind guardian_ at least 12 hours a day for 7 consecutive days before you can use its ability. After this, if the ring is not worn for 24 hours or longer, the mental patterns collapse and must be reestablished.  
  
The lashuntas of Castrovel devised the _mind guardians_ to protect the less mentally adept against outside control. Android engineers particularly skilled in the construction of self-aware neural networks assisted in the design. While most commonly found as a ring, a mind guardian can take the form of any compact piece of jewelry or personal adornment, but it functions only when in direct contact with the body.
