Levalochs study weapon technology of the mortal realm with keen interest. The devils have wielded trident-like weapons for millennia, but using fiendish ingenuity and information gained via infernal pacts with mortal weapon researchers, levalochs have developed ways to integrate modern technology into their tridents, combining cutting-edge science with ancient tradition. The tridents included in the table above are examples of levaloch successes in this area and are now common in the hands of levalochs throughout the planes.

# Levaloch Longarms

Although many among devilkind have long preferred melee weapons, levalochs understand that relying solely on close-quarters weapons places them at a disadvantage in contemporary times. Harnessing their creativity with weapons, levaloch weapon designers have addressed this issue by incorporating longarms into their tridents. You can integrate a non-analog longarm of equal or lower level into a levaloch trident by paying the cost of both weapons plus 10%. Once a non-analog weapon has been integrated with a levaloch trident, the trident loses the analog property.
