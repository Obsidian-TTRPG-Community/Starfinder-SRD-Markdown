# Hazard Professional

Emergency workers administer medical care, handle hazardous materials, evacuate disaster victims, and provide myriad other services in the wake of tragedy. They can be selfless idealists, exhausted municipal workers, or mercenaries who don’t lift a finger unless they’re under contract. Whatever their motivations, emergency workers are capable, resourceful, and tough, able to work long hours under difficult conditions.

## Description

Hazard professionals neutralize and clean up dangerous substances and explosive devices, disarming lethal obstacles before they can endanger others. This risky work often exposes these professionals directly to the peril they combat. Although catastrophic mistakes are often fatal, the experts pack heavy protection that deflects radiation, toxins, and shrapnel that might exist even when everything goes right. A typical hazard professional is trained to understand and deactivate a wide range of threats, including both technological and magical devices. Though usually used to remove threats, hazard professionals can easily weaponize their skills. Military units, terrorist organizations, and crime rings all welcome a canny demolitionist.
