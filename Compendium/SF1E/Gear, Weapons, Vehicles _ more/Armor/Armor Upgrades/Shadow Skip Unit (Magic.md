# SHADOW SKIP UNIT (MAGIC)
**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 55_  
**Item Level** 10; **Price** 19,000  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Any; **Bulk** L  
**Capacity** 3; **Usage** 1  
As a standard action, you can teleport from one area of dim light or darkness to another such area that you can see, with a maximum range of 60 feet. Activating this upgrade counts as moving from your space, provoking attacks of opportunity, though you have concealment (20% miss chance) against any foe that makes an attack of opportunity. A shadow skip unit’s charges replenish at a rate of 1 charge for every 8 continuous hours the upgrade (or its armor, if installed) spends in dim light or darkness, and entering an area of brighter light for more than 1 round resets the recharge time. This is a teleportation effect.
