# LASHUNTA MAGIC GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 145_  
**Item Level** 5; **Price** 3,200; **System** All Hands  
Most lashuntas have the ability to cast minor spells, even if they haven’t formally studied spellcasting. With tiny attuned crystals or magically aligned plates in your palms, you can cast daze and psychokinetic hand at will and detect thoughts once per day as spell-like abilities. The caster level for these effects is equal to your level.
