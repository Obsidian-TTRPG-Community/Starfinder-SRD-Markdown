Parks are common on starships designed to spend years between ports and include native plant life from one or more planets with compatible biomes. Parks are lighted, irrigated, and ventilated to replicate terrestrial conditions. Many crew members stationed on starships for long periods avoid cabin fever by spending time in a park expansion bay. Parks typically include a hydroponic system for plants as well as benches, walkways, and sometimes games or playgrounds if families are on board. Abilities that require a natural or wild environment (such as a trailblazer weaponâ€™s ability to ignore natural cover) function within a park.
