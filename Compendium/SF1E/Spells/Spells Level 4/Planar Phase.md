## DESCRIPTION

You open and step through an extraplanar detour that teleports you to any unoccupied space within the spell’s range, as per dimension door. Choose one of the following damage types: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, or fire. Your brief jaunt through another plane doesn’t harm you, but it does infuse your weapons with that plane’s matter or energy, causing your weapon attacks to deal additional damage of the chosen type for the spell’s duration. If you cast this spell as a standard action, the spell’s range is 5 feet per caster level, and your weapons deal an additional 3d8 damage with your first successful attack, 2d8 with the second successful attack, and 1d8 with the third successful attack. If you cast this spell as a move action, the spell’s range is 5 feet per 3 caster levels, and your weapons deal an additional 3d4 damage with your first successful attack, 2d4 with the second successful attack, and 1d4 with the third successful attack. If your attack would damage multiple creatures, you deal the additional damage to one creature of your choice.
