# MAGIC RESISTOR
These platinum armor plates have protective arcane sigils etched into them. They must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before they function, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. The upgrade draws on your own life force and experience to grant you spell resistance. The amount depends on your level, key ability score, and the upgrade’s type, as listed below. 

-   **Mk 1 (Level 11)**: Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +4) + your character level 
-   **Mk 2 (Level 14)**: Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +5) + your character level + 1 
-   **Mk 3 (Level 17)**: Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +6) + your character level + 2 
-   **Mk 4 (Level 20)**: Spell resistance = your key ability score modifier (maximum +7) + your character level + 3

The mk 3 and mk 4 models can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.
