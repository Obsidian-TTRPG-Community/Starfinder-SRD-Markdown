# ASPECTS
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 53_  
The following are the most commonly adopted vanguard aspects. ##  Apocalypse

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 36_  
You embody the cataclysmic distortion and acceleration of natural entropy when exposed to reality-warping magic.

**Aspect Insight (EX)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (grapple) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Mysticism checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Su)**: Once per combat, when a spell or spell-like ability that requires an attack roll misses you, or you succeed at a saving throw to negate the effects of a spell or spell-like ability, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional actions.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each foe within 30 feet takes damage equal to your vanguard level and is subject to an additional effect (Fortitude negates). Roll 1d6 for each affected foe, using the result to determine the damage type and effect.

_Improved_: The damage increases to twice your vanguard level. You can roll 1d6 twice for each affected foe, choosing one of the two results to apply.

| D6 | DAMAGE AND EFFECT                                  |
|----|----------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Acid damage and entangled for 1 round.             |
| 2  | Bludgeoning damage and knocked prone.              |
| 3  | Cold damage and fatigued for 1 round.              |
| 4  | Electric damage and staggered for 1 round.         |
| 5  | Fire damage and burning 1d6 per 4 vanguard levels. |
| 6  | Sonic damage and sickened for 1 round.             |


**Aspect Finale (Su)**: When you’re affected by a hostile spell that you have identified with a Mysticism check, you can spend 3 Entropy Points as a reaction to reflect some of the magic back at the spellcaster (Fortitude negates), causing them to also be affected by the spell as though they were one of its original targets.

##  BOUNDARY

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 53_  
You embody the forces that keep a system separated from its surroundings, isolating the reach of its entropy.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (sunder) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Perception checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat encounter, when an attack misses you or hits but fails to damage you, or you succeed at a saving throw that negates an effect, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each ally within 30 feet gains the ability to use your mitigate class feature without spending Entropy Points once within the next 10 rounds, using your vanguard level to determine the amount of damage reduced.

_Improved_: Each ally within 30 feet can instead use your mitigate ability twice in the next 10 rounds.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: When you use your mitigate ability, it applies to all attacks against you until the end of your next turn. This doesn’t apply to allies using it as a result of your aspect catalyst.

##  CASCADE

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 54_  
You embody a single change in the balance of a system’s entropy that cascades into additional, progressively greater changes.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (sunder) as a bonus feat and also a +2 insight bonus to Acrobatics checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you hit multiple creatures in a single round with an attack or attacks (or effects that require an attack roll), you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each foe within 10 feet must succeed at a Reflex save or gain the blinded condition for 1d4 rounds.

_Improved_: Each foe within 30 feet must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or gain the blinded condition for 1d4 rounds.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: When you damage a target with your entropic strike, as a reaction you can spend 1 Entropy Point to either apply a –2 penalty to that target’s AC, saving throws, or attack rolls (your choice), or halve the value of all DR and energy resistance the target has. These penalties do not stack, but you can apply different penalties to a single target with multiple hits. The effect lasts until you apply one of these effects to a new target or until the end of your next turn. If you successfully damage a target that has one of these penalties, the penalty’s duration is extended until the end of your next turn.

##  DISOBEDIENCE

**Source** _Starfinder Allies Against the Eye pg. 48_  
You embody the social entropy that occurs within societal systems when participants within social hierarchies become dissatisfied and rebel against it.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Feint as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Diplomacy checks. Select one of your class skills; that skill is no longer a class skill for you, but you gain Bluff as a class skill instead. At 5th level, you gain a +2 bonus when you use Bluff to feint in combat.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you hit a target with your entropic strike, and that target is suffering a penalty due to your successful use of Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate (for example, if you’ve successfully feinted or demoralized them), you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each foe within 10 feet must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds. While confused, the creature always acts normally and isn’t forced to attack the last creature that attacked it, but it still suffers all the other negative effects of being confused.

_Improved_: Each foe within 10 feet must succeed at a Will save or be confused for 1d4 rounds.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: As a reaction when you hit a target with your entropic strike, and that target is suffering a penalty due to your successful use of Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate (for example, if you have performed a successful feint or demoralized them), you can spend 1 Entropy Point to deal 1d4 Intelligence and Charisma damage to the target, but this effect can’t lower the target’s Intelligence or Charisma below 1.

##  EXERGY

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 54_  
You embody the total amount of potential work the energy in a system can perform when accessed by entropy.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (trip) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Intimidate checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you make two or more attacks in the same turn, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each foe within 30 feet must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an additional 1d6 damage per 2 vanguard levels from the next damaging attack that hits it within the next minute.

_Improved_: The additional damage is 1d6 per vanguard level.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: When you hit a foe with your entropic strike and the attack roll is a natural 18 or 19 (meaning the d20 shows an 18 or 19), you can apply one critical hit effect of that attack to your target, but you do not double the damage. This critical hit effect is treated as a critical hit for purposes of abilities that affect critical hits. If you roll a natural 20, the normal critical hit rules apply instead.

##  INDETERMINACY

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 47_  
You embody the fundamentally random nature of subatomic particles, including their instability, interactions, variations, and the unseen connections between them.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (reposition) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Bluff checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you use a reaction, make an attack of opportunity, move, or are moved when it’s not your turn, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: You transform the area around you on a subatomic level, causing matter to move and bend unpredictably. You create a 15-foot emanation centered on you that functions as difficult terrain for all movement types until the end of your next turn. When this effect ends, the resumption of normal physics causes all creatures in the area to become off-target until the end of your next turn. You’re unaffected by your aspect catalyst.

_Improved_: When the effect ends, any creature in contact with a floor, wall, or similar solid surface finds themselves momentarily glued to that surface as normal physical laws resume; the creature attempts a Reflex save, becoming entangled for 1 round if it fails. Your allies are unaffected by your aspect catalyst.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: As a reaction when you are dealt damage by a melee attack, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to rip the matter colliding with you from this plane and send it to another. This deals damage to the weapon that damaged you, or to your attacker if the weapon was a natural or unarmed attack, as if you hit it with your entropic strike.

##  INEVITABLE

**Source** _Starfinder Allies Against the Eye pg. 43_  
You embody the inevitability of a universe slowly but methodically decaying to its ultimate state of total entropy.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (disarm) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Intimidate checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you attack with a combat maneuver, you gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each foe within 30 feet must attempt a Fortitude saving throw or contract radiation sickness.

_Improved_: The frequency of the radiation sickness is now 1/hour.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: When you score a critical hit with your entropic strike, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to unleash a torrent of entropic energy; if you do, enemies within 15 feet of you take damage as if they’d been hit by your entropic strike (though the damage isn’t doubled for your critical hit).

##  INVERSION

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 54_  
You embody the role chaos plays within entropy, sometimes temporarily reversing its natural progression.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (reposition) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Medicine checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat encounter, when you regain Hit Points or Stamina Points, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: All allies other than yourself within 60 feet regain Stamina Points equal to twice your vanguard level. Creatures without Stamina Points (such as most NPCs) do not regain Hit Points from this ability.

_Improved_: All allies other than yourself within 60 feet regain Hit Points equal to triple your vanguard level. If a creature reaches maximum Hit Points before using this full value, any excess restores the target’s Stamina Points.

**Aspect Finale (Ex)**: As a reaction when you fail a saving throw, you can spend 1 or more Entropy Points to reroll that saving throw. You gain a bonus to this saving throw equal to the number of Entropy Points you spend.

##  MOMENTUM

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 55_  
You embody energy states that are preserved in ongoing motion, isolated from entropy

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (bull rush) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Culture checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you move a distance greater than your normal speed in one turn (using multiple move actions, the run full action, or a bonus to speed that allows you to move beyond your normal maximum), you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Creatures you select in a 60-foot radius are pushed away from you. A targeted creature moves 30 feet directly away from you but can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the distance.

_Improved_: Targeted creatures that fail their Fortitude saves are also knocked prone and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 2 vanguard levels you have.

**Aspect Finale (Sp)**: You can cast _telekinetic projectile_ at will as a spell-like ability. Rather than dealing the spell’s normal damage, both the target and the projectile take damage as if you hit them with your entropic strike. Additionally, you can spend 2 Entropy Points to cast _telekinesis_ as a spell-like ability, but only using its combat maneuver option.

##  OBSOLESCENCE

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 36_  
You embody the entropic force of being left behind by the progress of others. You know that all good things must inevitably end, replaced by superior innovations.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (disarm) and a +2 insight bonus to Engineering checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when an enemy’s attack or effect causes you to gain a condition, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each enemy within 20 feet experiences an equipment malfunction, causing one piece of equipment in their possession to gain the broken condition (Fortitude negates). This affects equipment in the following order, skipping any equipment that enemy does not have and randomly determining the target if the enemy has multiple items of the same type that qualify: item in hand, armor worn, active technological item, stowed weapon, any other item. As a full action, a creature can attempt a new Fortitude save to end the item’s broken condition, otherwise it remains broken for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier. NPCs with armor broken by this effect take a –2 penalty to AC.

_Improved_: Each enemy within 20 feet instead has two of their items malfunction, requiring a separate Fortitude save for each.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: When you use your mitigate ability to reduce damage you take from a weapon within 30 feet, you can cause that weapon to become incomprehensibly outdated until the end of the attacker’s next turn (Fortitude negates). An outdated weapon gains the archaic weapon special property and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls. Once affected, a weapon becomes immune to this ability for 24 hours.

##  REACTION

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 55_  
You embody the change entropy brings about through biological, chemical, and molecular reactions, such as rust and rot.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (dirty trick) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Physical Science checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Su)**: Once per combat, when you impose a condition on an enemy, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each foe within 30 feet must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or gain the sickened condition for 1 round per vanguard level.

_Improved_: One target of your choice within this ability’s range is also nauseated for 1 round if it fails its Fortitude save.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: You can spend 2 Entropy Points as a reaction to expose a creature you injure to entropic toxin. The save DC is determined as normal for an aspect ability. Once you apply this poison to a target, the target is immune to further applications of your entropic toxin for 24 hours.

### ENTROPIC TOXIN

**Type** poison (injury, special); **Save** Fortitude (DC varies)  
**Track** choose Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma (special); **Frequency** 1/round for 3 rounds  
**Effect** The target cannot progress beyond impaired/stiffened on the progression track.  
**Cure** 1 save

##  REBOUND

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 36_  
You embody energy’s ability to spring back, arresting and even reversing entropy’s flow to restore recently scattered matter.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (disarm) as a bonus feat and a +2 insight bonus to Diplomacy checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Su)**: Once per combat, when you prevent damage to yourself or an ally (such as with a mitigate class ability or In Harm’s Way feat), you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking any additional actions.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: You and all allies within 30 feet gain hardness equal to your Constitution modifier for 1 round. During this time, you can strike your allies with your entropic strike without making an attack roll, and your entropic strike doesn’t deal damage to your allies but instead restores an equivalent number of Hit Points. An ally can’t regain Hit Points from your entropic strike more than once per hour.

_Improved_: You can make one attack with your entropic strike against an ally when you use your aspect catalyst.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: As a reaction when you regain stamina or hit points, you can spend 1 or more Entropy Points to replicate half of this effect on allies within 30 feet. You effect a number of allies equal to the number of Entropy Points you spend. Stamina and Hit Points regained from this ability can’t be further replicated or increased in any way.

##  REGRESSION

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 36_  
You embody the inevitable collapse of advancement to make way for simpler things, making you an agent of the inevitable step back that accompanies every two steps forward.

**Aspect Insight (Ex)**: You gain Improved Combat Maneuver (sunder) and a +2 insight bonus to Survival checks.

**Aspect Embodiment (Ex)**: Once per combat, when you deal damage to an object or creature with the technological subtype, you can gain 1 Entropy Point without taking an additional action.

**Aspect Catalyst (Su)**: Each ally within 30 feet gains your entropic strike class feature (using your vanguard level – 2 to calculate its damage) until the beginning of your next turn.

_Improved_: Your allies use your vanguard level + 0 to calculate the entropic strike’s damage, and the granted entropic strike gains the penetrating weapon special quality and the corrode (1d8 for every 3 vanguard levels you have) critical hit specialization.

**Aspect Finale (Su)**: You can spend 2 Entropy Points as a reaction to trigger a chain reaction when you deal damage with your entropic strike to an object or creature with the technological subtype. Choose another object or creature with the technological subtype within 30 feet of the first target, and make a second attack with your entropic strike at a –4 penalty. If you hit and can perform additional reactions that turn, you can use another reaction to perform a third attack against a different object or creature with the technological subtype.  
You determine line of sight and the range of this attack starting from one corner of the first target’s space. The second attack is treated as an attack in a full attack for the purposes of abilities that reduce the penalties for full attacks.
