# COUNTERMEASURE - ALARM

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 215_  
**Price** 10 credits; **Type** Countermeasure  
One of simplest countermeasures, this program sends an alert to a specific individual or station if someone attempts to breach the system. If the computer has a control module connected to an actual alarm, this countermeasure can trigger that alarm. If the computer controls a robot, trap, or weapon, an alarm can also activate them. The alarm countermeasure costs 10 credits.
