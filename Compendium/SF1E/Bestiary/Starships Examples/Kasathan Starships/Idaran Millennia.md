## DESCRIPTION

The Idaran Millennia resembles a sleek bird skull, with delicate, rippled fins. When cruising, the ship remains compact, yet in combat its “beak” opens to reveal a magnetic launch strip capable of firing a swarm of fighters into the fray with incredible speed. Even more disturbing, its fins detach, floating in a perfect magnetic field lock—their purpose is a highly classified secret.
