# Healing Pods

**PCU**:: 2
**Cost (in BP)**:: 3  
Healing pods can be installed only in a biomechanical starship.  
A biomechanical starship can channel energy from its self-repair mechanism to its parts, including its healing pods. These pods benefit any creature that rests in them whenever the biomechanical starshipâ€™s self-repair criteria are met. A creature that does so regains twice the number of ability points or Hit Points it would by healing naturally. Resting in a healing pod also grants a creature a +2 circumstance bonus to Constitution checks for long-term stability and saving throws against diseases, drugs, and poisons for 24 hours. A healing pods expansion bay contains six pods that can each accommodate a Medium or smaller creature. A Large pod can be installed in place of two Medium ones.
