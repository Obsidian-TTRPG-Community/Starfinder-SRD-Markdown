### Description

Similar to flash suppression, modern weapons have sound-suppression hardware built in to protect users and bystanders from high-decibel reports, but this doesn’t make a weapon silent. A hybrid _silencer_ uses magitech to truly silence a weapon. When you fire a weapon equipped with a _silencer_, the weapon creates no sound, and its ammunition flies silently for the first range increment (this includes the range increment of a weapon with the sniper special property). This benefit reduces the penalty you take to Stealth checks for sniping by 5. You can combine a _silencer_ and _flash suppressor_ together by paying the combined price of both accessories. Their benefits stack.
