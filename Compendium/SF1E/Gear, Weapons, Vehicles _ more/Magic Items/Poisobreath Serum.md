### Description
For 1 hour after you drink a poisonbreath serum, you can exhale a dangerous poisonous mist. This grants you a +2 enhancement bonus to Intimidate checks against adjacent living creatures that can smell your breath. During the serum’s duration, you can take a standard action to breath a cloud of poisonous mist in a 15-foot cone. Each living creature in the area is affected by insanity mist (Core Rulebook 419). Once you’ve breathed out the poison, the serum’s other effect immediately ends.|
