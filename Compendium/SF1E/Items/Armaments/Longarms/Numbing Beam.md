# Numbing Beam

Complex algorithms, controls, and safeguards within a numbing beam ensure the weapon never lowers its targetâ€™s temperature to lethal levels. Tactical and advanced numbing beams see use in populated areas, while elite and paragon numbing beams are more often employed in military endeavors. Those models intended for use near civilians include prominent external computer interfaces, as though to advertise their safety features, while military models tend toward a sleek, traditional design.

### Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
