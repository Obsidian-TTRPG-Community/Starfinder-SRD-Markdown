A shrieking knife remains silent until it strikes a target, only then emitting a shrill burst of lethal frequencies. Harmonic models use focused sound arrays that are similar in their output, while interference versions combine sounds to increased effects. Infrasonic and ultrasonic models are like the interference version, but they also use sound waves outside the normal hearing spectrum.

# Sonic Weapons

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
