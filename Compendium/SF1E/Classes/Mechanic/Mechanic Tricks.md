# MECHANIC TRICKS
You learn your first mechanic trick at 2nd level and an additional trick every 2 levels thereafter. Mechanic tricks all require you to meet a minimum mechanic level, and they are organized accordingly. Some mechanic tricks require you to satisfy other prerequisites, such as having other tricks.

## 2ND LEVEL

You must be 2nd level or higher to choose these mechanic tricks.  

###  ATTENTIVE TAMPERING (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder The Chimera Mystery pg. 48_  
You have a soft touch and naturally conceal signs of your tampering. Do not increase the DC of Engineering checks to hide your attempts to disable a device. 
###  CALIBRATE SPEED (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 18_  
Your experimental armor prototype enables faster movement. Your experimental armor’s speed adjustment is increased by 5 feet (maximum 0 feet) while you’re wearing it. At 8th level, you instead ignore the armor’s speed adjustment. You must have an experimental armor prototype to select this mechanic trick. 

###  COMBAT MAINTENANCE (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 146_  
As a move action, you can fortify an item you touch against attack. The item’s hardness increases by an amount equal to your mechanic level (to a maximum of double its normal hardness) for 1 round. If the item is one you are wearing or holding, you can use this ability as a purely defensive reaction to an attack against it. 

###  DISTRACTING HACK (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 71_  
You can hack a computer within 30 feet of a foe to distract that foe, such as with a sudden noise or an image. You must be able to access the computer (whether it is your own computer or you are within range to access one manually or via remote hack). This functions as a feint action except that it uses your Computers skill instead of Bluff, so you can apply the benefits of Improved Feint and Greater Feint if you have them. 

###  ELECTROMAGNETIC DEFLECTION (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 61_  
When you activate your energy shield, choose two of the following damage types: cold, electricity, or fire. While your shield is active, you gain resistance to the chosen damage types equal to half your mechanic level. You must have the energy shield mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  ENERGY SHIELD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 71_  
As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to activate an energy shield around yourself. This shield provides you with a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier plus your mechanic level. The shield remains active for 1 minute per mechanic level or until all of its temporary Hit Points are depleted, whichever comes first. Once used, you cannot use this ability again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest; your shield automatically shuts off during this period of rest. 

###  EXPLORATION ROUTINE (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 18_  
You’ve installed routines in your drone that enable it to adventure efficiently through strange and alien worlds. Add the following to the list of feats your drone can select: Ambush Awareness, Climbing Master, Echolocation Attack, Environmental Adaptation, Memory Access, and Swimming Master. Additionally, your drone gains one of these feats as a bonus feat when you select this trick (it must meet the skill rank prerequisites for the feat). You must have a drone to select this mechanic trick. 

###  EXPLOSIVE ARTIST (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 23_  
Choose one feat that includes proficiency with grenades as a prerequisite. You gain this feat as a bonus feat, and you can qualify for that feat as though your base attack bonus from your mechanic levels were equal to your mechanic level. 

###  FUSION SPECIALIST (EX)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 23_  
When you apply a fusion seal to a weapon, it functions after 1 hour rather than the normal 24. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point while applying a fusion seal to instead have the seal function immediately after you transfer it. 

###  HACK DIRECTORY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 71_  
Whenever you attempt to hack a system and fail the check, you immediately become aware of any countermeasures that were activated due to your failure. You can then select one of these countermeasures and attempt another Computers check (with the same DC as the original). If you succeed at this second check, you can prevent that countermeasure from activating, as if you had not attempted to access the system at all. Any other countermeasures have their normal effect. 

###  HUNK OF JUNK (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 127_  
You can appear to be a defunct piece of junk.As a move action, or as a reaction whenever you take damage, you can attempt to appear defunct. You immediately fall prone and attempt an Engineering check against each opponent who’s aware of you (DC = 10 + the opponent’s Sense Motive bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater). Anyone you succeed against believes you’re useless mechanical junk and acts accordingly. An opponent who closely inspects you as a standard action can attempt an Engineering, Perception, or Sense Motive check at the same DC to uncover your deception. Maintaining this ruse is a full action each turn.  
This trick can be taken only by characters who can be targeted by effects that only affect constructs, including those of the construct type and those with the constructed species trait. 

###  MAGIC SCANNER (EX)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 23_  
As a standard action, you attune your custom rig to detect the presence and nature of magical effects in the area, gaining the effects of the detect magic spell. You can use this to identify the properties and command words of magic and hybrid items, using Computers to identify magic in place of Mysticism. 

###  MAGITECH OFFICER (EX)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 23_  
When acting as a magic officer (Starfinder Character Operations Manual 148) during starship combat, you can use Engineering in place of Mysticism to resolve crew actions. You can perform magic officer crew actions as though you had a number of ranks in Mysticism equal to the number of ranks you have in Engineering.

### NATURAL COMPUTER (EX)

**Source** _Near Space pg. 129_  
With 1 minute of work, you can use your custom rig to create a basic computer interface on a natural unworked surface, such as on the ground, a tree, or a rock face. The interface requires a power source and uses 1 charge per hour. If you are a plant creature, this instead takes a standard action and does not require a power source. The interface is attuned to unmodified material of the type on which it is placed. You know the general direction and distance of attuned materials, and you can use the interface to surveil its surroundings at distance of up to 50 feet × your mechanic level. The surveillance square has ordinary vision but can see only out to 30 feet. 

###  NEURAL SHUNT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
Once per day, as a reaction when you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, you can shunt that effect into your exocortex instead. When you do so, you are not affected by the mind-affecting effect, but for the normal duration of that effect, you lose the Skill Focus feat granted by your exocortex’s memory module and cannot use any of the exocortex’s abilities in any way (including any proficiencies and mods it grants you). When a mind-affecting effect is shunted into the exocortex, spells such as _dispel magic_ or _break enchantment_ can be cast on you to end the effect as if you were affected by it. Once the duration of the mind-affecting effect has ended, your exocortex resumes its normal functions. You must have an exocortex to learn this trick. 

###  NIGHTVISION PROCESSOR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
Your visual data processor allows you to see better in conditions of poor lighting, granting you low-light vision and darkvision to a range of 60 feet. You must have the visual data processor mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  OVERCHARGE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to overcharge and attack with a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered special property (see page 181) that you’re holding. If you hit, you deal 1d6 additional damage of the same type the weapon normally deals. This attack uses three times as many charges from the battery or power cell as normal and can’t be used if the weapon doesn’t have enough charges. This trick has no effect on a weapon without a battery or power cell. You can instead use this ability as a move action on a touched powered weapon that is unattended or attended by an ally to grant the same effect to that weapon’s next attack before the beginning of your next turn. 

###  OVERCLOCKING (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
You have augmented the performance of your AI for maximum response timing. You gain a +2 insight bonus to initiative checks, and either you (if you have an exocortex) or your drone (if you have a drone) gains a +2 insight bonus to Reflex saves. 

###  OVERLOAD WEAPON (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
As a full action or as a move action by spending 1 Resolve Point, you can cause a powered weapon (either a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered special property) in your possession to explode. You can use the weapon as if it were a grenade of the weapon’s item level or lower dealing the weapon’s normal damage type, except the weapon has a range increment of only 10 feet unless it is a thrown weapon. If someone tries to attack with the weapon, it explodes as a grenade would instead, centered on the user, and the user doesn’t receive a Reflex save to negate the grenade’s effect (if any). Once you’ve primed a weapon to explode in this way, it’s difficult to reverse the effect, requiring 8 hours of work and a successful Engineering check (DC = 15 + your Engineering bonus); failing the check by 5 or more detonates the weapon. Once detonated, the weapon is destroyed, just like a grenade. 

###  PORTABLE CHARGING STATION (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 74_  
You can use your custom rig to recharge batteries. You can spend 10 minutes in contact with a battery and restore its charges to full. Once you have used your portable charging station a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence bonus (minimum 1), you can’t do so again for 24 hours. 

###  PORTABLE POWER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
You can use your custom rig to supply limited power for up to 1 minute to a computer or starship system that lacks power. If this system is part of a much larger network, this trick does not supply power to the entire network, just to a limited point of access (typically a terminal), which might greatly limit functionality. Once you have used portable power on a system, you cannot do so again on that system for 24 hours. 

###  PROJECTED SHIELD (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 25_  
When you activate your energy shield mechanic trick, you can apply its effects to an adjacent ally instead of to yourself. If your energy shield grants additional benefits, such as from the facet deflection trick, you also apply those additional benefits to the ally instead of yourself. Your energy shield ends immediately if the target is ever more than 100 feet away from you. If you activate your energy shield ability a second time (such as with the boost shield trick), any other energy shield you have active ends immediately. You must have the energy shield mechanic trick to select this trick. 

###  PROTECTIVE PROGRAMMING (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 74_  
Once per day as a reaction when you fail a Reflex saving throw against an attack or spell that deals damage, if your drone is within 10 feet of the line between you and the damaging effect, you can direct your drone to interpose itself between you and the source of that damage. Your drone takes the damage the attack would have dealt to you, and you take no damage. If your drone is reduced to 0 Hit Points, it is destroyed until you repair it or build a new drone. You must have the drone option of the artificial intelligence class feature to choose this trick. 

###  PROVISIONAL REPAIR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 146_  
As a standard action, you can temporarily patch up a broken weapon or technological item to suppress the penalties from the broken condition for 1 minute per mechanic level. This does not restore any Hit Points to the item, and it does not function on an item reduced to 0 Hit Points. Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, once per combat you can perform the hold it together action in the same round you perform another engineering action. 

###  QUICK PATCH (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
When you attempt to patch a system on a starship, you reduce the number of actions required to do so by one. This does not reduce the time needed to patch a glitching system, but you can patch two systems with one action. 

###  QUICK REPAIR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
When you attempt to repair an item, you can do so in half the time normally required (to a minimum of a full action). 

###  RECALIBRATE ENGINE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 146_  
As a full action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a touched vehicle’s engine with your custom rig to get a little more or less power out of it for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you undo it as a full action. The vehicle gains a +10 foot enhancement bonus to its speed and a +50 feet (+5 mph) enhancement bonus to its full speed (to a maximum of double) and its Piloting modifier is reduced by 2. You can also penalize its speed to increase its piloting modifier.

Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat you use the recalibrate engine ability in place of any other engineering action. The ship gains a +2 enhancement bonus to its speed for 1 turn, and the Piloting check made in the Helm phase to determine the order of movement of starships gains a +2 enhancement bonus, but all other Piloting checks made that turn take a –5 penalty.

### REMOTE PILOT (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 23_  
Your custom rig can exercise delicate control over your vehicle, which gains an autopilot function (Core Rulebook 280) with a Piloting bonus equal to 4 + 1-1/2 the vehicle’s item level. You can use your custom rig control the autopilot at a range of 500 feet, allowing you to engage, disengage, or enter coordinates for the autopilot as if you were in the vehicle. This range increases to 5 miles if you have the expert rig ability, 50 miles if you have the advanced rig ability, and has a planetary range if you have the superior rig ability.  
You must have the experimental vehicle class feature to choose this trick. 

###  REPAIR DRONE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
When you repair your drone in either manner described on page 74, you repair 25% of its maximum Hit Points instead of 10%. You must have a drone to learn this trick. 

###  SAMPLE SCANNER (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 18_  
Your exocortex is adept at analyzing field samples. As a move action, you can place items or materials weighing up to 1 bulk into your custom rig and direct your exocortex to analyze them. This functions as taking 20 to recall knowledge about the items, but it takes 10 minutes to perform, instead of the usual 2 minutes. While scanning an object, you can’t use your exocortex’s memory module, and the number of targets you can designate your exocortex to track is reduced by one. You must have an exocortex to select this mechanic trick. 

###  SPELL CHIP ARRAY (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 127_  
You’ve built in a receiver for spell chips. You can insert a number of spell chips equal to half your level. Using these spell chips has the same requirements as normal. Because you have the chips linked in an array, you can expend a spell chip to cast a spell on any other spell chip you’ve inserted of the same or higher spell level. A spell chip array is difficult for creatures not aware of it to locate; someone performing a close inspection can discover it with a successful Mysticism or Perception check (DC = 10 + your total Engineering skill modifier).  
This trick can be taken only by characters who can be targeted by effects that only affect constructs, including those of the construct type and those with the constructed species trait. 

###  SPELL CHIP UNDERSTANDING (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 23_  
You can use spell chips (Core Rulebook 215) as if you were a spellcaster. For the purpose of using spell chips, you treat all spells as your class’s spell list, and you use Intelligence as your key ability score for your spellcasting. Your effective caster level for spell chips you use is your mechanic level. 

###  STRANDED INVENTIONS (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 18_  
You know how to make the most of your available resources, which comes in handy while exploring lower-tech worlds. In place of UPBs, you can use an equivalent value of raw materials on worlds with medium or low technology to craft technological items, but when you do so, you can craft items only of that world’s technology level or lower. Alternatively, you can craft a technological item whose item level doesn’t exceed your number of Engineering ranks – 2, regardless of the world’s technology or resources (subject to GM discretion). Armor or weapons you make using this trick gain the archaic property, technological items or weapons that use batteries can be used only once per day, and tool kits that provide bonuses to skill checks halve the granted bonus. 

###  TECH TINKERER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 146_  
You know how to modify the functions of UPBs to radically alter how items work. With 10 minutes of work, you can modify a technological item so that it temporarily functions as any other lower-level technological item of the same or lower bulk (losing its original function while in this new form). The item must have an item level and bulk no greater than half your mechanic level. If the new item requires a battery that has more charges than the original device’s battery (or another source of power or fuel not present in the original item), you must also provide the appropriate battery or power source. Any charges or similar expenditure from the new item come from the original item (if possible) or the new power source you install (if one was required). The new item retains the original item’s bulk. Any damage dealt to the new item is retained when it returns to its original form. If the item is broken or destroyed in its modified form, it remains broken or destroyed when it returns to its original form and must be repaired or replaced normally.

This change lasts for 10 minutes per mechanic level or until you undo it with 10 minutes of work. You cannot modify or produce armor, augmentations, hybrid or magic items, items with limited uses or charges (such as batteries, drugs, or fuel), or weapons, although you can produce an item that uses charges from a battery or fuel if there is a separate battery or power source to power it. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability to modify an item whose level is equal to your mechanic level, giving it the function of a lower-level item. 

###  TECHNOLOGICAL MEDIC (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 75_  
You can use your knowledge of machines and technology to repair androids and robots. Whenever you attempt a Medicine check to assist an android, SRO, or other creature with the constructed racial trait or construct (technological) subtype, you can use your Engineering skill instead of Medicine to achieve the same results. Your custom rig acts as a medkit for this purpose (or an advanced medkit, if you are 5th level or higher). 

###  TERMINAL UPLINK (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 18_  
You can use your exocortex to stay vigilant. As a full action, you can upload your exocortex into a computer to which you have root access, directing it to monitor that computer. Once your exocortex is integrated, your custom rig alerts you whenever a creature operates or attempts to hack the computer, similar to the alarm countermeasure. Your exocortex upload can be removed from the computer by other users as if it were a module. If you upload your exocortex into a different computer, you lose the benefits of terminal uplink with the first computer, and the exocortex upload on that computer deletes itself 1d10 minutes later.  
If you upload your exocortex into a computer with a camera, microphone, or other similar monitoring device, you can perceive the computer’s surroundings with that hardware by using your custom rig, so long as you’re within 100 feet per mechanic level you have of the computer. While observing the computer’s surroundings in this way, you can’t use your exocortex’s memory module, and the number of targets you can track with your exocortex is reduced by one. You must have an exocortex to select this mechanic trick. 

###  VISUAL DATA PROCESSOR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
You notice even the smallest shifts in movement, temperature, and vibration, gaining the insight bonus from your bypass class feature to Perception skill checks.

## 8TH LEVEL

You must be 8th level or higher to choose these mechanic tricks.  

###  ARTIFICIAL PILOT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 18_  
Your drone has learned to operate vehicles quite independently. When you’re piloting a vehicle in which your drone is a passenger, you can engage autocontrol (or engage autopilot, if you have the expert AI ability) as part of the action you use to drive or race, even if the vehicle doesn’t have an autocontrol or an autopilot function. If the vehicle doesn’t have an autocontrol or autopilot function, your drone must spend its actions each round to maintain the engaged function. If it’s unable to do so, the autocontrol or autopilot stops functioning. You must have a drone to select this mechanic trick. 

###  BOLSTER ARMOR (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 75_  
As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to modify a touched suit of light armor, heavy armor, or powered armor, granting it a number of temporary Hit Points equal to half your mechanic level. Any damage to the armor or its wearer is subtracted from these temporary Hit Points first. These temporary Hit Points last 1 minute or until reduced to 0. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again unless you expend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.  
Additionally, when acting in the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single quadrant of your starship. You bolster that section of the ship’s armor or defensive countermeasures, increasing the ship’s Armor Class or Target Lock (respectively) in that quadrant by 2 for a number of rounds equal to your mechanic level; alternatively, you can restore a number of Shield Points in that quadrant equal to your mechanic level. 

###  BOOST SHIELD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
Your energy shield grants you a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier + double your mechanic level. In addition, if you have already used your shield, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use it again without having to regain Stamina Points first. This replenishes your shield’s temporary Hit Points to full. You must have the energy shield mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  BROADCAST TELEMETRY (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 19_  
Your exocortex can broadcast crucial combat data to allies. When you use your combat tracking exocortex ability to track a creature, as a swift action, you can grant an ally the ability to make attacks against that target as if their base attack bonus were equal to your mechanic level. If you do, attacks you make against that target use your normal attack bonus. To benefit from this ability, the ally must be within 30 feet and have an active comm unit (such as those installed in most armor) or have a cybernetic or magitech eye(s) augmentation; if the ally has both a comm unit and applicable augmentation, you can broadcast to that ally at a range of 60 feet. When you use this trick, exocortex abilities that increase the number of targets you can track with combat tracking instead increase the number of targets that your ally can track.  
This ability lasts until you end it with a swift action, you become unconscious, you can no longer perceive the target, or the ally moves beyond this trick’s range. You must have an exocortex to select this mechanic trick. 

###  DEBUG CURSE (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 23_  
Your custom rig is able to analyze and disable curses’ underlying magic. While in possession of your custom rig, you gain a +3 resistance bonus to saving throws against curses. Once per day, you can use your custom rig to remove a curse from a creature or object, per the spell remove affliction, using your mechanic level as your caster level. 

###  DIVIDED UPLINK (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 19_  
You can keep your exocortex uploaded to a number of computers equal to half your Intelligence bonus (minimum 2) while using your terminal uplink mechanic trick. If your exocortex is uploaded to only one computer, you can monitor that computer’s surroundings without preventing you from using your exocortex’s memory module. Your uploaded exocortex is protected by a firewall countermeasure. You must have the twin tracking exocortex ability to select this mechanic trick. 

###  DRONE MELD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 72_  
As a full action while in contact with your drone, you can reconfigure it into a mechanical drone suit (or a backpack-like apparatus, for the Tiny hover drone) that you can wear. While in this form, the drone can’t take any actions or use any of its abilities, but you gain either the drone’s flight system mods if you have a hover drone, reactive camouflage (and an invisibility field if your drone has it) if you have a stealth drone, or reductive plating if you have a combat drone. You can end the meld and return the drone to its normal form as a full action. Though it normally acts on your turn just after you, the drone can take no actions on that turn other than transforming back. 

###  ENERGY REFLECTION (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 25_  
When you or your drone are dealt damage that’s subsequently reduced by your energy resistance, you can reflect some of that damage as a reaction. The source of the damage takes energy damage equal to the amount you or your drone resisted (Reflex half), dealing the same type of damage as was resisted. You or your drone must have a mechanic trick or drone mod that grants energy resistance (such as electromagnetic deflection, resistance, or resistant energy) to select this trick. 

###  ENGINE PLASMA (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 23_  
During the engineering phase of starship combat, you can perform a special engineer crew action called vent engines. As your starship moves during the next helm phase, it fills a number of consecutive hexes it departs with hazardous energy; the number of hexes filled can’t exceed your Intelligence modifier. The energy dissipates at the beginning of the following turn’s helm phase. Any starship that enters one or more of these hexes before then takes damage equal to 1d4 × your starship’s tier, distributed evenly across all four quadrants. You can use this action once per combat, though you can use it additional times by spending 1 Resolve Point for each additional use. 

###  ENGINEER'S EYE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
When you are within 10 feet of a trapped or malfunctioning machine or computer, you receive a free Computers, Engineering, or Perception check (as decided by the GM) to notice the trap or defect, whether or not you are actively looking. In addition, due to your intimate knowledge of your ship, you receive one of these checks whenever you board your ship to notice if anything is wrong with the ship’s systems. 

###  GEOMAGNETIC CHARGE (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 61_  
As a reaction once per round while your energy shield is active and you reduce damage taken with your electromagnetic deflection trick, you can redirect the dissipated energy into a ranged energy weapon or melee weapon with the powered special property that you’re holding. The next time you hit with that weapon before the end of your next turn, you deal additional damage equal to the reduction provided by your electromagnetic deflection. You must be at least 8th level and have the electromagnetic deflection and energy shield mechanic tricks to learn this trick. 

###  GHOST INTRUSION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
Whenever you use the Computers skill to access a system and you fail to overcome its defenses by 4 or less, you do not trigger any countermeasures and there is no log of your attempt. If you fail by 5 or more, any countermeasures take effect against you as normal. 

###  HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTOR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
Your custom rig can project holographic images as a standard action as often as you like, as per 2nd-level holographic image except it can create speech and has a range of only 120 feet. 

###  HYPERCLOCKING (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
You further improve the response time of your AI. If you have a drone, your drone gains a +1 insight bonus to AC. In addition, if your drone is subjected to an attack that normally allows a Reflex save for half damage, it takes no damage if it succeeds at its saving throw. If you have an exocortex, you gain a +1 insight bonus to AC. In addition, whenever you fail a Reflex saving throw, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll the saving throw (see page 243) and take the higher result. You must have the overclocking mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  IMPROVED OVERCHARGE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
The additional damage of the overcharge mechanic trick increases to 2d6. You must have the overcharge mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  INVISIBILITY BYPASS PROCESSOR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
Your visual data processor now allows you to see invisible creatures as per _see invisibility_. You must have the visual data processor mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  MANIFOLD SHIELD (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 25_  
You’ve optimized your energy shield to protect multiple targets simultaneously. When you activate your energy shield trick, you can create energy shields targeting a number of creatures within your melee reach equal to your one-fourth your mechanic level. Each target gains a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your Intelligence modifier. In addition, you distribute an additional number of temporary Hit Points equal to your mechanic level between the shielded creatures; if you have the boost shield trick, you instead distribute additional temporary Hit Points equal to twice your mechanic level. You must have the projected shield mechanic trick to select this trick. 

###  MOBILE ARMORY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 146_  
You can modify a weapon or armor upgrade (either of which must not be archaic or analog) with the tech tinkerer mechanic trick. You can turn a weapon into another weapon or an armor upgrade into another armor upgrade, or turn either a weapon or an armor upgrade into a technological item. If you turn a weapon into another weapon that uses a different type of ammunition, you must provide that ammunition separately. You must have the tech tinkerer mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  PROGRAM SPELL CHIP (EX)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 23_  
Your programming skills can achieve near-magical results. Choose two 0-level spells, two 1st-level spells, two 2nd‑level spells, and two 3rd-level spells from the technomancer spell list. You can craft spell chips of these spells, provided you have a number of ranks in Computers equal to the number of ranks in Mysticism that would normally be required. Rather than access to a workshop, you need access to a computer of a tier greater than or equal to the level of the spell you are programming into the spell chip. At 9th level and each subsequent mechanic level, you can choose one additional technomancer spell for which you can create spell chips. Beginning at 11th level, you can choose 4th‑level technomancer spells. At 14th level, you can choose 5th‑level technomancer spells, and at 17th level, you can choose 6th‑level technomancer spells. 

###  RAPID SCANNER (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 19_  
When you use the sample scanner trick, your exocortex takes only 1d4 minutes to analyze materials or items (rather than 10 minutes). Alternatively, you can choose not to accelerate the process, in which case the scanning process doesn’t prevent you from using your exocortex’s memory module and doesn’t limit the number of targets your exocortex can track. You must have the sample scanner mechanic trick to select this mechanic trick. 

###  RECALIBRATE WEAPON (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 147_  
As a standard action, you can use your custom rig to modify a touched ranged small arm, longarm, or heavy weapon. You can increase its range increment by 20 feet (or double, whichever is less), but doing so reduces the weapon’s damage dice by 1 when wielded by anyone other than you (for example, a weapon that would normally deal 3d8 damage deals 2d8 damage instead; a weapon reduced to 0 dice does 1 damage) or reduce its save DC by 2 for weapons that don’t use damage dice. You can instead reduce the range increment of such a weapon with a range increment of at least 40 feet to one-quarter its normal range and either increase its damage by 1d6 of its usual type or increase its save DC by 1 (for weapons that do not use damage dice). The item must be unattended or held by a willing creature. This change lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level or until you reverse the effect with a move action.

Additionally, when filling the engineer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action you can spend 1 Resolve Point to modify a single non-capital weapon. You either extend or shorten the weapon’s range by one step; doing so reduces its damage dice by 1 (such as 4d4 to 3d4, with weapons reduced to 0 dice doing 1 damage) or increases its damage by 1d6, respectively. You can’t reduce a weapon’s range below short or extend it beyond long. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level or until you undo the recalibration as a push engineer action. 

###  RESISTANT ENERGY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
Even when your energy shield is inactive, the ambient energy protects you from a particular type of energy attack. Choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. You gain resistance 5 against that energy type. You must have the energy shield mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  SCOUTBOT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
You’re always crafting rudimentary bots in your spare time, and can use them to scout. It takes you 10 minutes and 1 Resolve Point to create a scoutbot. A scoutbot is a Small technological construct, its EAC and KAC are equal to 10 + your mechanic level, and it has 1 Hit Point per mechanic level you have (and no Stamina Points). It has a land speed of 30 feet, and you can control its movements with your custom rig as a move action. It has a camera that streams visual and auditory data back to your rig. The scoutbot uses your saving throw bonuses if necessary. It is untrained in all skills and has a +0 bonus in all of them, though you can use your own Perception skill when examining the feed from its stream. Once created, the scoutbot lasts for 1 minute per mechanic level you have before falling apart unless otherwise destroyed. 

###  SHOCKING OVERLOAD (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 75_  
You can use your overload or override class feature to damage a creature. When you successfully use overload to cause a short in an electronic device in someone’s possession and the item’s owner fails their Reflex saving throw, that creature takes electricity damage as a result of the power surge. This surge deals 1d6 electricity damage per 4 levels of mechanic you have. When you use your override class feature to affect an android, drone, robot, or other creature with the technological subtype, that creature takes 1d6 electrical damage per 2 levels of mechanic you have and can attempt a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half your mechanic level + your Intelligence modifier) to negate this damage. 

###  STRANDED INNOVATIONS (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 19_  
Your skill at crafting with low-tech resources is superb. You can use your stranded inventions mechanic trick to craft a technological item whose item level doesn’t exceed your ranks in Engineering –1. If you craft a technological item or weapon that uses batteries, it doubles the usage, but it isn’t limited to a single use per day and requires eight hours to recharge. You must have the stranded inventions mechanic trick to select this mechanic trick. 

###  TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATOR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 147_  
Choose two mechanic tricks you meet the prerequisites for but don’t have. Once per day as a move action, you can gain one of these tricks for 10 minutes. Each time you gain a mechanic level, you can replace one of these mechanic tricks with another that you meet the prerequisites for but don’t have. 

###  TOOL MODULE (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 19_  
You can spend 10 minutes (during which time you can’t rest to recover Stamina Points) installing a technological item that you can operate with one hand into your experimental weapon prototype. While you’re holding your experimental weapon prototype in at least one hand, you can use the installed item as if you were holding it. If the technological item and your experimental weapon prototype both use batteries of the same capacity, they can expend charges from each other’s batteries. The technological item remains joined to the weapon until you uninstall it with 10 minutes of work. You can’t have more than one item installed in your experimental weapon prototype at a time. You must have an experimental weapon prototype to select this mechanic trick. 

###  VEHICULAR MIRACLE (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 23_  
You can use your miracle worker mechanic class ability one additional time per day, and you can also affect non-starship vehicles with that ability. If the vehicle isn’t wrecked, you restore a number of the vehicle’s Hit Points equal to twice your class level. If the vehicle’s new Hit Points aren’t high enough to remove its broken status, the vehicle functions as if it weren’t broken until the end of your next turn. If you also spend 1 Resolve Point, you can use this ability on a wrecked vehicle, though the vehicle only functions for a number of minutes equal to your Intelligence modifier before being reduced to 0 Hit Points and becoming wrecked again. You can only restore function to a specific wrecked vehicle in this way once, after which that vehicle becomes immune to subsequent uses of the ability. You must have the miracle worker mechanic class ability to choose this trick.

## 14TH LEVEL

You must be 14th level or higher to choose these mechanic tricks.  

###  ENERGY TRANSFERENCE (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 25_  
Inspired by a shimreen’s ability to amplify damage, you’ve modified your custom rig to do the same. Whenever you take energy damage and have your custom rig in your possession, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to channel some of that energy into one, two, or three weapons within 30 feet of you. The affected weapons are each supercharged, as supercharge weapon. 

###  EXPERIMENTAL CORTEX DESIGN (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 19_  
You harness technologies normally available only to those with an exocortex. You gain the overclocking mechanic trick, and you’re treated as having an exocortex for the purposes of the overclocking, hyperclocking, and ultraclocking mechanic tricks. You must have neither a drone nor an exocortex to select this mechanic trick. 

###  EXTRA MOD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
If you have a drone, your drone gains an additional basic mod. If you have an exocortex, you gain an additional basic mod. It can’t be a basic mod taken a second time as an advanced mod. You can rebuild this extra mod when you gain a mechanic level as with any other mod, but you can’t rebuild this mod to convert it into the advanced version of the mod. 

###  IMPROVED RESISTANT ENERGY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
Choose an additional energy type from resistant energy. You gain resistance 15 against both this and your original energy type. You must have the energy shield and resistant energy mechanic tricks to learn this trick. 

###  INVENTIVE ENGINEER (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 75_  
You are adept at recalibrating and enhancing a starship’s systems. When acting in the engineer or chief mate roles during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily boost your starship’s capabilities. Choose one of the following options. Any change lasts for 1 turn of starship combat per mechanic level. A ship can benefit from only one of these options at a time; if it gains another of these benefits from any source, any previous inventive engineer benefit ends.  
**Amplify Shields:** You double the regeneration speed of your ship’s shields.  
**Angle Shields:** Select one weapon arc of your starship. Any attack made against you from a starship in that arc takes a –1 penalty to the attack roll.  
**Countermeasures:** Your starship’s TL increased by 1.  
**Low Power Mode:** You reduce the PCU cost of a specific system by 10 (minimum 5 PCU).  
**Speed Boost:** You increase your ship’s speed by 2 hexes. 

###  INVISIBILITY-HAMPERING PROJECTOR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
As a move action, you can use your custom rig’s holographic projector to project a holographic image in a direct overlay over an invisible creature within 120 feet, and your custom rig’s computer moves the image to follow the invisible creature, effectively negating the creature’s invisibility as long as it remains within 120 feet of you. If it moves beyond that range, it breaks the effect until you use this ability again. You must have the holographic projector, invisibility bypass processor, and visual data processor mechanic tricks to learn this trick. 

###  MELDED MOD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 147_  
When you use your drone meld trick, your drone retains access to one of its basic mods. If the mod grants the drone abilities, attacks, or senses, you can use that ability, attack, or sense. If the mod lets the drone take an action without you commanding it to (such as the medical subroutine mod), the drone can end the drone meld and perform that action if the circumstances that would normally cause it to do so are fulfilled. If the mod requires equipment or tools that are not granted as part of the mod, you must have the appropriate equipment or tolls, separate from your drone, to use the mod. You can’t choose a mod that requires another mod. You must have the drone meld mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  MOD TINKERER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
You can spend 24 hours of uninterrupted work to exchange all your drone or exocortex mods at any time, even if you haven’t gained a level. Any other drone features (such as its chassis or bonus feats) can still be exchanged only when you gain a level. 

###  PROTOTYPE TINKERER (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 75_  
You can spend 8 hours of uninterrupted work to rebuild your experimental prototype at any time, even if you haven’t gained a level. You may do this even if it is broken or destroyed, and can even rebuild it from scratch if you have appropriate spare parts or scrap. This allows you to exchange any customizations you have selected. You must have an experimental prototype to learn this trick. 

###  SABOTEUR (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 73_  
Whenever you use the Engineering skill to sabotage or disable a device, you can roll twice and take the better result. In addition, if you have the appropriate tools (including your custom rig), performing these tasks takes half the normal amount of time, to a minimum of 1 move action. 

###  SCOUTBOT MOD (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 147_  
Whenever you create a scoutbot, you can give it one basic drone mod. You must have the scoutbot mechanic trick to learn this trick. 

###  SUPERIOR OVERCHARGE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 74_  
The additional damage of the overcharge mechanic trick increases to 4d6. You must have the overcharge and improved overcharge mechanic tricks to learn this trick. You can select this trick multiple times. Each time you do after the first, increase the damage by 1d6 (to a maximum of 7d6 if you select it all four times). 

###  SUPERIOR SCIENCE OFFICER (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 75_  
You excel at operating starship computer systems, and you can exploit your ship’s programming in ways others can’t. When acting in the science officer role during starship combat, instead of taking any other action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily enhance your starship’s computer. Any change lasts for 1 round per mechanic level. A ship can benefit from only one of these options at a time; if it gains another of these benefits from any source, any previous superior science officer option ends.  
**Improved Sensors:** Your scan actions reveal an additional piece of information about the starship being scanned. For instance, if your Computers skill check to scan a starship succeeds by 5 or more, you learn two pieces of information instead of one.  
**Targeted Sensors:** When you perform a scan action, you can choose which information category to learn information about, regardless of the normal order of information you would learn.  
**Upgrade Node:** You divert additional power to your starship’s computer, granting the computer’s bonus to one additional starship combat check per round. ##  Ultraclocking (Ex)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 74_  
If you have a drone, you can grant the effects of haste to your drone for 1 minute as a move action. If you have an exocortex, you can gain the effects of haste for 1 minute as a move action. Once you or your drone has used this ability, you cannot use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points from a 10-minute rest. You must have the overclocking and hyperclocking mechanic tricks to learn this trick.
