The grip of an interference blade contains sonic projectors that emit specific ultrasonic frequencies, overlapping the sound waves until they become a physical edge. When you swing the weapon, this blade is visible as a blurred, translucent line. Monophonic interference blades generate a single pitch. Harmonic models use several pitches that amplify one another. A polyphonic blade projects variable frequencies, while a multiphonic version combines several frequencies in a single edge.

# Sonic Weapons

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
