# Environmental Field Collar

Environmental field collars, or EF collars, are a common form of protection for creature companions that accompany their owners into dangerous situations. These simple bands, often affixed to a neck or limb, automatically activate in hazardous environs, generating an environmental field around a creature companion of a particular size. This field provides the same environmental protections as a suit of armor (Core Rulebook 196), except that the duration of these protections is based on the collar’s battery usage rather than its item level. As a full action, you can affix an EF collar to (or remove one from) an adjacent creature companion, either yours or a willing or unconscious ally’s. While worn, the bulk of the collar does not count as bulk carried.
