As a move action, you can activate this set of optical lenses and magitech circuitry. This upgrade must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. While the upgrade is activated, you can see invisible creatures within 120 feet as translucent shapes, per _see invisibility_. _An invisibility detector’s_ charges replenish each day.
