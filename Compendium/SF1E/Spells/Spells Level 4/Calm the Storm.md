## DESCRIPTION

Developed by ikeshti brood-minders and congregants who moved beyond the threat of becoming a rivener, this spell is a celebration of the mental fortitude that one needs to resist one's urges and to shrug off outside influence. You gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against all spells and effects with the mind-affecting descriptor. If you would fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect while under the effects of _calm the storm_, you can reroll the failed saving throw as a reaction. If you do, _calm the storm_ ends.
