## Formian Myrmarch Cr 10"

[[Myrmarch Toxin]]

## Description

Formian taskmasters and myrmarchs each serve highly specialized roles within their hive-organized species. Taskmasters are typically 5 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, while myrmarchs average 8 feet in height and weigh around 1,200 pounds.
Formian taskmasters play a mercantile role and often represent formian interests abroad. Formian myrmarchs are almost never seen outside of the hive. These aristocratic members of formian culture are the queen’s agents and advisors, generals of formian armies, and leaders of complex civic projects. They are deadly combatants, but their real power comes from their ability to elicit extraordinary performance from the entire hive.

## Extra Content

The following extra content was found for this creature:
\- Formian Race Entry
Formians resemble giant ants with humanoid upper bodies, and carve their chitinous plates with insignias reflecting their individual names and achievements. Members of a hive all share a telepathic link, allowing them to coordinate efficiently. Within a hive are castes specialized to particular tasks. The queen leads the hive and is its sole means of propagation, while castes like the aristocratic myrmarchs and mercantile taskmasters direct lower castes like warriors and workers. Formians are most common on Castrovel. For millennia they sought to eradicate the lashunta, their traditional foes, but their queens now instead focus on adopting other species’ technology to industrialize their traditional hive societies.
