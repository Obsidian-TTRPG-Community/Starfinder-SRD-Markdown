## Description

This spell arises from ghorans' tradition of imbuing their group projects and celebrations of togetherness with magic. Targets gain a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against fear effects while they're observing at least one other target of the same casting of this spell. Also, when a target successfully aids another target of the same casting of this spell, or provides such a creature covering or harrying fire, the bonus from successfully doing so is +3 instead of +2.
