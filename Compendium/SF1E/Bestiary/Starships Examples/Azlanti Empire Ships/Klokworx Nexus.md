## Description

Drone carriers are standard in the Imperial Fleet, providing fighter support without the need for living pilots. The Klokworx Nexus, manufactured by the empire’s leading military contractor and automation firm, is the most common drone carrier in the imperial navy. This vessel sees wide use across the empire, from defending space stations to providing backup to other capital ships in large-scale battles. Alongside gunner teams, Nexus carriers employ squads of military science officers to manage and enhance the drones’ performance in combat.
