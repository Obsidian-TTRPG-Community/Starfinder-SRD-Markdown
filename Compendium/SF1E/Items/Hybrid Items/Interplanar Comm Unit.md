# Interplanar Comm Unit

Comm units capable of piercing the barriers between planes are rare. Such marvels of hybrid technology are typically controlled by powerful organizations, and their use is closely monitored. An interplanar comm unit can communicate only with other interplanar comm units that are on a single specific plane, and it can send or receive only two messages per day.
