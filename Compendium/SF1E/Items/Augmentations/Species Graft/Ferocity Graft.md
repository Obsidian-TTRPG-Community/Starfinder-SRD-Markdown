# Ferocity Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 144_  
**Item Level** 5;
**Price**::  3,000; **System** Heart  
Orcs, half-orcs, and shobhads are known for fighting even after their wounds should otherwise have brought them down. A series of tiny pumps within your heart fill it with chemicals allowing you to stay upright when you would otherwise be knocked unconscious. Once per day, when you are brought to 0 Hit Points but not killed, you gain the dying condition (following the normal rules for death and dying) but can continue to act normally until the end of your next turn, when you become unconscious as normal. If you take additional damage before that, you cease to be able to act and fall unconscious.
