Benefit: When you begin a full night’s rest or begin a full day’s rest, you can choose to enter a special form of regenerative torpor instead of sleeping normally. Upon completing your rest, you regain twice the normal number of Hit Points, heal twice the normal points of ability damage, and gain a +2 circumstance bonus to any saving throws you attempt to remove negative levels that day. While in this torpor, you’re difficult to rouse; if awoken before you finish resting, you’re flat-footed and fatigued until you can rest for at least 8 more hours.
Prerequisites: Con 13, any species that grants at least 6 Hit Points at 1st level
