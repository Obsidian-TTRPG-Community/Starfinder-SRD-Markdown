# Deception Node

**Source** [_Interstellar Species pg. 75_](https://paizo.com/products/btq02d4w?Starfinder-Interstellar-Species)  
**Item Level** 8;
**Price**::  9,500; **System** Brain  
When activated as a swift action, this artificial organ translates your subconscious thoughts into inane chatter that you hardly notice but that psychic intruders find jarring. While the system is active, you gain a +2 resistance bonus to saving throws against effects that read your thoughts (such as detect thoughts). Also, any creature contacting you with telepathy or reading your thoughts must succeed at a Will save (DC = 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modifier) or become dazzled and unable to communicate with their telepathy for 1d4 rounds; if they’re concentrating on a spell that reads your thoughts, they lose concentration, potentially ending the spell. You can deactivate the node as a swift action. Once a creature successfully saves against your deception node, they’re immune to it for 1 hour.  
If you have two deception nodes installed, they provide you greater control over your mental chatter, and you can activate or deactivate both as a swift action. While both are active, the resistance bonus to saving throws increases to +3, and the DC to resist the nodes’ effect increases by 1. If a creature reading your thoughts fails the saving throw, rather than dazzling them and interrupting their concentration, you can instead provide false thoughts to the creature. Doing so functions as telling a lie using the Bluff skill, though you reduce any DC modifier from the creature’s attitude by 5 if they’re unfriendly or hostile.
