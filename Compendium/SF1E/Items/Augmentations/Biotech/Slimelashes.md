# Slimelashes

**Source**:: _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 83_  
**Level**:: 4
**Price**::  1750 
**System**:: Hand  
Slimelashes were developed to help technicians retrieve tools that drift out of reach without needing to uncouple and risk drifting away themselves. A pair of specialized glands embedded into your palm can launch a protoplasmic tendril and quickly retract it. While this allows for quick retrieval of small items, the tendrils are not able to move heavier objects. If you have a hand free, you increase your natural reach by 10 feet when picking up unattended items of less than 1 bulk. You also can increase your natural reach by 10 feet when attempting a disarm combat maneuver with a free hand. If you succeed at the disarm maneuver, you can automatically grab the item before it falls, but only if it is less than 1 bulk.
