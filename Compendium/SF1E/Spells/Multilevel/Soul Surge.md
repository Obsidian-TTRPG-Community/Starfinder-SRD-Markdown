## DESCRIPTION

_Soul surge_ was innovated by Hanakan mystics concomitant with the attunement of their soulstones. With this spell, you draw forth a tiny bit of your essence to attack your opponent, losing a number of Hit Points equal to the number of damage dice you roll for your soul surge. Attempt a ranged attack against a single target's EAC, adding your key ability score modifier to the attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier if it's higher. Your _soul surge_ does piercing damage that has the force descriptor, and the amount of damage it does depends on the level at which it's cast.
