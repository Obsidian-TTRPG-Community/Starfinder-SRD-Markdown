# STABILIZER SPRINGS
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 85_  
**Item Level** 1; **Price** 400  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Light, Heavy; **Bulk** —  
These carefully calibrated, high-quality springs installed around the ankles and knees of the armor make your stance more balanced. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance on narrow surfaces, a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against trip combat maneuvers, and a +2 circumstance bonus to Reflex saves against effects that knock you prone (such as the _grease_ spell or the knee shot operative exploit).  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
