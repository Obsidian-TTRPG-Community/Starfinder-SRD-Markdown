Those who rely on speaking to persuade or please others and those who require the ability to gauge an audience find an _improvisation adornment_ invaluable. This item is usually something worn on or near the head, such as a necklace, headband, or a mask. While wearing this item, if you fail a Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive check, as a reaction you can reroll the check and take the better result. You can also reroll a Profession check, provided the GM agrees the check involved some sort of interaction, such as acting, musical performance, public speaking, and the like. Once you benefit from a given _improvisation adornment_, you can benefit from a different one only after 24 hours have passed.

The adornment allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.
