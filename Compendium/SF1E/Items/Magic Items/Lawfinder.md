### Description

This archaic, ornate compass is a holy trinket sacred to AbadarCorp, and its needle is shaped like a thin golden key. A _lawfinder’s_ needle always points toward the nearest settlement of at least 1000 people within such a settlement, the needle points to the primary center of government or civil administration for the settlement. This item can’t detect a settlement more than 100 miles away, except for settlements with the bureaucratic quality, which a _lawfinder_ can detect up to 1000 miles away. If no such settlements are within range, the _lawfinder’s_ needle spins slowly.  
  
As long as the _lawfinder’s_ needle points to a settlement or civil center, it grants you a +2 insight bonus to Survival checks to avoid getting lost.
