Benefit: When you craft two or more of a specific item at a time, you must expend only 90% the normal number of UPBs when creating all subsequent copies of that item (or 80% if your number of ranks in the appropriate skill to craft the item exceeds that item’s level by 5 or more). This discount when crafting subsequent copies of the item persist until you either go 24 hours without making another of that item or until you make any other type of item.
