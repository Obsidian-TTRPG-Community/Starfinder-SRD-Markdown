Trox are intimidating creatures with sturdy, chitinous shells, and this augmentation grants you an artificial version of that armor which you can use to shield your allies. When you fight defensively or take the total defense action, you can grant half the bonus to AC granted by that action to an adjacent ally (who receives that bonus only as long as they remain adjacent to you).
