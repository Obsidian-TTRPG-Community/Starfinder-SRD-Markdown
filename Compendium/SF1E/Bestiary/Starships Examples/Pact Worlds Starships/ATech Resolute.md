## Description

The ATech Resolute is a simple, sturdy ship with a bold personality and a beloved subculture. AbadarCorp first commissioned the Resolute over a century ago to meet its growing need for a deep space freighter that didn’t need an escort. An especially troubling surge in piracy had made the conglomerate’s colonial ambitions far too costly not to take more direct action. The answer came in the form of this blocky, golden hulk that, no matter how hard it was battered, wouldn’t give up the fight. To some customers’ chagrin, the same durability makes the factory-installed amenities difficult to upgrade
while the austere interior plastics are undeniably hardy, their most polite critics often describe them as “discouragingly industrial.”  
 
After AbadarCorp had built up a substantial fleet of Resolute vessels, the model became available to other companies and individuals, quickly gaining a reputation for its stellar reliability. Notable and varied operations like the Aspis Consortium, the Knights of Golarion, and the Golden League regularly employ the Resolute, not only representing a considerable fraction of the starship’s sales but also advertising the design’s reliability to independent pilots. Ironically, the Free Captains have also gained respect for the ships after battling them through the years, and have managed to commandeer a few more Resolutes than ATech would prefer. AbadarCorp occasionally posts bounties for these rogue starships, paying a reward based on the condition of a returned ship—less for proper documentation of its destruction.  
 
While the prolific AbadarCorp-owned fleet of Resolutes sports extensive golden filigree, independently owned ships are also richly decorated. In fact, the ships’ long lifespan and beloved reliability have endeared them to many, and it’s become a tradition for private owners to adorn their ships with baubles and paint them with bright, vibrant, and unique designs. It’s not uncommon for a Resolute to outlive its original owner and end up passed from generation to generation of budding entrepreneurs, with each new owner adding their own flair to the vibrant mess. AbadarCorp encourages this tradition by hosting various modding pageants as a low-cost way to protect its own visual brand, ensuring that its gold-hued vessels are distinctive as company property.
