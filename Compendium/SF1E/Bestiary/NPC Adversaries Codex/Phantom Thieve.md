# Phantom Thieve

Thieves are common throughout the galaxy, though more numerous in larger cities and space stations. They have a variety of methods and motivations for snaring others’ property; some thieves strike back against an amoral corporate system that left them behind, while others selfishly prey on those with little power to defend their possessions. PCs can encounter thieves in numerous circumstances, whether as unsavory associates, crafty foes, or on-again-off-again allies and rivals.

**Dispel Defenses (Su)** The phantom thief is adept at dispelling magical traps and protections. As a standard action, they can spend 1 Resolve Point to unravel a magical effect, as a targeted dispel magic, using their CR as their caster level for the dispel check.

## Description

Phantom thieves view themselves as the elite of the thieving world, carrying out their thefts with a trademark panache. Most phantom thieves exclusively target the wealthy, whose possessions present the most tempting targets. Many leave behind some sort of calling card to mark a theft as their work.
