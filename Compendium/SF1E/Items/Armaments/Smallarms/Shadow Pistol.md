# Shadow Pistol

Inspired by the Shadow Plane—or, some say, followers of Zon-Kuthon—a shadow pistol replicates the energy of the Plane of Shadow to momentarily separate the target from the thermodynamic energy of the universe, damaging it with the instantaneous change in temperature. With their shadowy appearance, the caliginous and sable models resemble guns cut from polished obsidian, while the more advanced tenebrous and umbral models look more like they were cut from the blackness of space.

### Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
