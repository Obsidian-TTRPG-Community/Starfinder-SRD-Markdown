    desc: "A kyokor has an exoskeleton that is harder than most metals, and it can therefore use its body against urban structures with deadly effect. A kyokor’s natural weapons ignore the hardness of all structures not made of adamantine alloy or a harder material. Against structures made of such materials, a kyokor’s natural weapons ignore half of the structure’s hardness."

    desc: "The force with which a kyokor destroys structures is laced with strange, ancient psychic energy. When a kyokor attacks a structure, all creatures within 100 feet with an Intelligence modifier of –3 or higher must succeed at a DC 25 Will saving throw or be stunned for as long as the kyokor is attacking a structure or any other creature within 100 feet. Each time the kyokor attacks a creature that a stunned victim can see, that victim can attempt a new saving throw. If a kyokor attacks a stunned creature, the stunned effect immediately ends. This is a mind-affecting fear effect."
  - name: "Sense the Masses (Su)"
    desc: "Large concentrations of sentient creatures are like beacons of light that call to kyokors. A kyokor can sense groups of 2,000 or more intelligent creatures gathered together in a single settlement out to 5 miles. This ability does not allow a kyokor to know exactly how many creatures are in a given location, but it does allow it to pinpoint pockets of intelligent life and know which pockets are the most populous."
  - name: "Massive (Ex)"
    desc: Because Kyokor are so massive, uneven ground and other terrain features that form difficult terrain generally pose no significant hindrance to a Kyokor's movement, though areas of forest or settlements are considered difficult terrain to a Kyokor. A Huge or smaller creature can move through any square occupied by a kaiju, or vice-versa. A Kyokor can make attacks of opportunity only against foes that are Huge or larger, and can be flanked only by Huge or larger foes. A Kyokor gains a bonus for being on higher ground only if its entire space is on higher ground than that of its target. It's possible for a Huge or smaller creature to climb a Kyokor—this generally requires a successful DC 30 check, and a Small or larger creature that climbs on a Kyokor's body provokes an attack of opportunity from the monster.

## Kyokor Cr 20

# Kyokor

## Description

Kyokors are one of the most common types of colossi that rampage like a living apocalypse across the ruined planet Daimalko (see page 464 of the Starfinder Core Rulebook for more information). These mammoth, bipedal alien horrors are large enough to take out an entire city block with a few sweeps of their hulking claws, and in fact this seems to be exactly what they evolved—or were designed—to do.
Kyokors are enormous juggernauts covered in shell-like exoskeletons of armored plates, from between which they can extrude hundreds of wriggling tonguelike appendages. They have occasionally been observed using these grotesque tendrils in those rare situations in which they need fine manipulation ability (though they may have others uses as well). Certainly the jagged crablike claws on their arms are useless for grabbing anything smaller than a boulder
these are used almost exclusively to spear and smash. A kyokor has an armored skull with a strangely elongated chin, tiny glowing eyes peeking out from a cavernous gash, and sharp growths like a crown of teeth rising from the top of its head. A single kyokor is typically about 150 feet tall and weighs more than 20,000 tons.
Although most Daimalkans who have ventured to the planet’s surface have seen at least one kyokor from afar, only a handful of the bravest explorers and heroes have ever seen one up close. Most known information about these colossi comes from bloodstained, hastily scrawled records created during the Awakening (the planetwide cataclysm that released the kyokors and other colossi from their slumber deep within the oceans). According to these dossiers, kyokors have the ability to sense large populations of humanoids from incredible distances and to grip their victims’ minds in fear as they gleefully destroy whole cities. The latter ability leaves populations at the mercy of the beasts, and likely contributed to how quickly Daimalko fell into ruins during the Awakening. It’s also said that kyokors are capable of speech, but that no one alive has heard a kyokor’s voice.
Kyokors target population centers, and they seem to equally revel in the fear they produce as they demolish buildings and snatch up tiny humanoid snacks to eat. The monsters are voraciously hungry, but whether it’s destruction or meat that sustains them is unknown. Kyokors exhibit surprising intelligence and are fiercely independent. They occasionally fight other colossi in grudge matches that blast entire landscapes.
Among citizens of the Pact Worlds, rumors swirl about elite bands of Daimalkan colossi hunters who have taken down kyokors and reaped impossible riches from their corpses. Given the creatures’ history, though, the veracity of such claims is question.

## Kyokor Plating

Scavengers on Daimalko dare to brave the wastes of their world to gather the enamel-like hulls that kyokors occasionally shed from their crowns. These toothy moltings are enormous, and once they’re retrieved, they require a great deal of effort to grind into plates that can be used to craft armor. Despite this and the dangers of gathering the requisite moltings, suits of kyokor plating are in demand throughout the universe, making collection of the raw materials and subsequent forging into lucrative careers.
Suits of kyokor plating are tough and surprisingly lightweight for their size, and the moltings’ porous nature makes this armor perfect for the installation of various upgrades and other methods of personalization. Lower-quality suits are fashioned from numerous pieced-together blasted fragments, sacrificing durability for lower cost. High-quality suits are fashioned entirely from sleek, fitted enamel plates, which offer practically unparalleled protection but can be restrictive when it comes to a wearer’s range of motion.
