SFS Legal Themeless (+1 Any)
Source Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 28
If you decide that none of the themes above fit your particular character concept, you can choose not to have a theme. You then gain the following benefits at the listed levels. A themeless character is considerably less powerful than a character with a theme, so choose this option with care.
General Knowledge (1st Level)
You gain a class skill of your choice when you create a themeless character. Also, you gain an ability adjustment of +1 to any ability score you choose.
Certainty (6th Level)
Once per day before you roll a skill check, you can gain a +2 bonus to that skill for that check.
Extensive Studies (12th Level)
Choose a skill that is a class skill for you. Once per day, you can reroll one such skill check before learning the results of the roll. You must take the second result, even if it is worse.
Steely Determination (18th Level)
Increase your pool of Resolve Points by 1.
