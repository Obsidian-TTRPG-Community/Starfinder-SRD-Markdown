This upgrade enables you to sense magic within 60 feet, as detect magic. While active, the module continuously delivers complex data about nearby magic, but this information is functionally meaningless unless you concentrate on it. As a standard action, you can overclock the module, temporarily increasing its usage to 4/round and causing its effect to function as arcane sight.
