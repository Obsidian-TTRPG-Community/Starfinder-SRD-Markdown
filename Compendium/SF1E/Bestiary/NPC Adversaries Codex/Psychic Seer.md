# Psychic Seer

Investigators uncover secrets and sift truth from lies. This often places investigators on the side of the law, but when the powers that be are corrupt, investigators might find themselves labeled vigilantes or ostracized. Yet they aren’t easily discouraged, and can become relentless foes.

## Description

Psychic seers read the thoughts and intentions of others as easily as most would read a story. Due to the intrusive nature of their abilities, psychic seers sometimes experience legal limitations or even prejudice. Thus, these investigators often don’t advertise their talents openly, instead framing their skills as uncanny hunches and specialized know-how. However, in more tolerant communities, psychic seers often serve as leaders.
