### DESCRIPTION

A sleep pod has an area not much bigger than that of a bed, and is available as a stand-alone pod in a public area or as the smallest room or apartment available in a hotel or living complex. Frequently, 3â€“5 sleep pods are stacked atop each other in each section, and a hallway may have hundreds of such units. Showers and restroom facilities are often communal, and no allowance is made for cooking or cleaning.
