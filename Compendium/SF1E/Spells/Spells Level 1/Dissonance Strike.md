## Description

You harness the vibrations in your body and a body you strike. Attempt a melee attack against the target's EAC. If your attack hits, the target takes 4d4 sonic damage (critical deafen; DC equals your spell save DC) and can't take reactions for 1 round.

Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
