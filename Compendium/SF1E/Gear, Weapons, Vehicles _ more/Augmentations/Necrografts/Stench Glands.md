# STENCH GLANDS
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 97_  
**System** Skin  
Stench glands are a concentration of undead sweat glands located mostly in your armpits that can emit a foul, debilitating odor. As a standard action a number of times per day equal to your stench glands’ mark, you can activate the necrograft to form a 10-foot radius cloud of stench centered on you that persists for 1 minute. Living creatures that enter your cloud must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be sickened until they leave the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds thereafter. A creature that succeeds at this save is unaffected by your stench for 24 hours. Creatures that do not breathe or use self-contained breathing are unaffected by your stench. You can halt the stench as a swift action.  
  
Mk 4 and mk 5 stench glands produce a particularly loathsome funk that can drive off most creatures. After the first round of being sickened by your stench, a creature in your cloud must succeed at another Fortitude saving throw or become nauseated until it leaves your cloud, after which it is sickened for 1d6+2 rounds. A creature that succeeds at this second Fortitude save remains sickened as normal, but it must continue to attempt a Fortitude save to avoid becoming nauseated each round it remains in your cloud.
