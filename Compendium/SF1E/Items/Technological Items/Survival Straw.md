### Description

This thin tube contains nanomachines and several filters that destroy contaminants or trap them in a washable compartment in the middle of the straw. When you activate a survival straw, water-based liquids you drink through it are automatically filtered and purified, removing any diseases, drugs, and poisons present in the liquid. A survival straw uses 1 charge per gallon of water filtered (or fraction thereof).
