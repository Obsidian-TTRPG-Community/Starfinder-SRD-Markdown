source: Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 27
When you successfully use a melee weapon with the block weapon special property to strike an opponent, you can also protect an ally adjacent to you. Both you and the ally gain the block property’s +1 enhancement bonus to AC against that foe’s melee attacks. The ally loses this bonus if they move outside your melee reach.
