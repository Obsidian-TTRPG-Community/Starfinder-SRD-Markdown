# TECHNOMANCER ALTERNATE CLASS FEATURES

# DRONE TECHNOMANCY

**Source** Tech Revolution pg. 34
**Class** Technomancer

You have created an extraordinary new life powered by your technomancy, providing you a skilled companion at the cost of your overall magical potential. You gain a drone artificial intelligence, using your technomancer level as your mechanic level. If you have additional levels in a class that provides you a drone artificial intelligence, you add them together to the determine the effectiveness of your drone. You gain one fewer spell slot per day of each level.
When you learn new magic hacks, you can choose to select any of the following mechanic tricks as though they were magic hacks, using your technomancer level as your mechanic level to qualify for these tricks: drone meld, extra drone mod, hyperclocking, mod tinkerer, overclocking, repair drone, and ultraclocking.
This alters spells and replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.

# IMMORTAL TUTOR
**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 34_  
**Class** Technomancer

You’ve learned technology from extraplanar experts. Choose one of the following categories that best fits your immortal tutor: aeon, celestial, elemental, fiend, inevitable, or protean. You gain the benefits associated with that tutor.  
At 1st level, you gain the ability to cast a specific variable‑level spell once per day without expending a spell slot as though it were one of your known technomancer spells, and you do so using the spell level equal to the highest-level technomancer spell you can cast.  
At 6th level, when you cast a 1st-level or higher technomancer spell, you can gain the tutor’s first lesson for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. After you do so, you can’t use the first lesson again until you have rested 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. At 12th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to gain the benefits of your patron’s second lesson. At 18th level, you learn your patron’s third lesson, which grants an additional benefit whenever the first lesson ability is active.  
This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.

You have learned reality-warping mathematics from the cosmos’s faceless custodians.

**Third Lesson:** You have a 60% fortification ability as if you had an active blue force field (Core Rulebook 206).

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 34_

# JUNK TECHNOMANCY

**Source** Tech Revolution pg. 34
**Class** Technomancer

Your magic easily recycles technological refuse into useful tools, literally making another’s trash into your treasure. You gain junk armor and junksword as 1st-level spells known. When you gain the ability to cast technomancer spells of a higher level, you add the next higher level of junk armor and junksword to your list of spells known. You immediately lose the lower level version of these two spells and replace them with one spell known for that lower spell level. Once per day, you can cast junk armor or junksword as a spell of the highest technomancer spell level that you can cast without expending a spell slot. When you cast junk spells—including any spells that specifically create or manipulate junk, such as junk armor, handy junkbot, or other spells as the GM’s discretion—you treat your technomancer caster level as 1 higher than normal.
At 3rd level, your techlore class feature grants its insight bonus to your Engineering checks rather than to Computers checks; it still grants you an insight bonus to Mysticism checks. At 6th level, armor you create or enhance with junk armor gains one armor upgrade slot. When you create a junksword, you can simultaneously place a weapon fusion seal into it whose item level cannot exceed half the spell’s caster level; the fusion seal is harmlessly returned to your hand when the spell ends.
This alters spells and techlore, and it replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.

# CACHE AUGMENTATION (EX)

**Source** Character Operations Manual pg. 92
**Class** Technomancer

Your studies of the fundamental forces of the galaxy have enabled you to enhance one of your body’s systems to benefit from the energy of stored spells. You might have been bestowed this augmentation by an order of technomancers, implanted the augmentation into yourself as part of your research, or witnessed part of your body undergo a technomantic apotheosis that left you with the ability to cast spells. Your cache augmentation takes the form of any cybernetic augmentation or magitech augmentation (Starfinder Armory 90) of your choice with an item level of 1. Each time you gain a level, the item level of your augmentation increases by 1, and you can replace it with a different augmentation with an item level equal to your technomancer level or lower. This augmentation counts toward the total number of augmentations you can have implanted into each of your body’s systems as normal.

At 6th level, each time you regain your spells, choose one of the following: attack rolls, Computers and Engineering checks, Fortitude saves, or Reflex saves. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of your chosen type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 12th level and +3 at 18th level.

At 12th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a second option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of this type. This enhancement bonus increases to +2 at 18th level.

At 18th level, each time you regain your spells, choose a third option from the 6th-level list. You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to rolls of this type.

These enhancement bonuses count as part of the effects of your cache augmentation, and if your augmentation is removed or its effects suppressed (such as by the reject augmentation spell) you also lose these bonuses.

This replaces spell cache and cache capacitor.

# CACHE HACKS (SU)

_SFS Note: Remove baleful polymorph as a 6th-level spell option; the rest of Genehacker’s Cache is legal for play_  
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 92_  
**Class** Technomancer

At 6th level, you can acquire a cache hack, a fundamental shift in the focus of your spell cache that alters the spells you can cast with the cache capacitor class feature. Choose one of the cache hacks described below; your cache capacitor can hold the listed spells instead of those described on page 120 of the Core Rulebook.

Some of the cache hacks described below allow you to place spells with targets into your cache capacitor. These spells are marked with an asterisk (\*). For such spells, you effectively gain the ability to cast the cached spell at will. You don't need to make any decisions required for the spell in advance, but their duration expires normally. Reestablishing one of these spells requires only that you cast the spell again; you don't need to spend 5 minutes reestablishing it. You can have only one instance of each spell active at a time, and casting the spell again causes the previous instance to automatically end, as if its duration had expired. After 24 hours, you lose the ability to cast the spell in your cache capacitor and effects produced by those spells immediately end, as if their duration had expired.

Aside from the change in the spell list and the changes listed above, your cache capacitor otherwise functions as described in the cache capacitor class feature. This alters cache capacitor.

# HACK CAPACITOR (SU)

**Source** Character Operations Manual pg. 92
**Class** Technomancer

You can adjust your magical knowledge, granting you the ability to hack your spellcasting in unexpected ways. Select three magic hacks that you do not have but whose prerequisites you meet. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of one of these magic hacks for 1 minute. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use hack capacitor again before the duration expires, you replace the previous magic hack with the new choice. If a magic hack you chose with hack capacitor has a daily use limitation, any uses of any magic hack from your hack capacitor count toward the hack’s daily limit. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one magic hack you selected with this ability with another choice.

At 12th level, select a fourth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of two magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 1 Resolve Point (or 2 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). Both magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability, so if you use this ability again during the same day, both magic hacks are replaced.

At 18th level, select a fifth magic hack. As a move action, you can gain the benefit of three magic hacks for 1 minute by spending 2 Resolve Points (or 3 Resolve Points if you have already used this ability during the same day). All three magic hacks count as a single choice for the purpose of this ability. At 19th level, you can use this ability as a swift action or a move action.

This replaces cache capacitor and resolve attunement.
