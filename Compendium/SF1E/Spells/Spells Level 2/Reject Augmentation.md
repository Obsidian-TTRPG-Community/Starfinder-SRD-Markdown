**Casting Time** 1 standard action  
**Range** medium

## DESCRIPTION

You urge the target creature’s natural systems to reassert themselves, causing its body to temporarily reject augmentations that have been installed in its systems. For the spell’s duration, the creature is sickened and can’t use any augmentations that require an action to activate. Creatures that don’t have augmentations are not affected by this spell.
