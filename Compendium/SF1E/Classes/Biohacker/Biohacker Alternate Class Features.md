# Biohacker Alternate Class Features

## Auto-injector (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 18_  
**Class** Biohacker  
  
You can create compact devices that inject their user with a biohack booster in response to specific conditions. While spending 10 minutes to create biohacks, you can transform any number of the created biohacks into auto-injectors and implant them in nearby creatures to whom your custom microlab is attuned. Each auto-injector occupies either the recipient’s endocrine body system for augmentations or one of their armor’s upgrade slots. When implanting the device, you must choose both the auto‑injector’s biohack and its triggering condition, such as “this ally is attacked” or “this ally attempts a Fortitude save.” When the triggering condition occurs, the auto-injector activates, injecting the booster into the ally without using an action. The injection takes effect before resolving the triggering action, so a granted AC bonus might avert an otherwise successful hit, a saving throw bonus applies to the triggering save, and so on. The biohacker can use a reaction to delay this auto-injector, preventing it from activating when its condition triggers. With 1 minute of work, the biohacker can remove an auto-injector and install it into another ally’s armor, or they can change the auto-injector’s triggering condition.  
An auto-injector counts against the biohacker’s total number of biohacks they can have ready at one time and remains functional for 24 hours or until they create a biohack to replace it.  
This modifies the biohacks class feature and replaces the minor biohacks class feature.

## Ley line Hacker (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 18_  
**Class** Biohacker  
  
Like an arcane phlebotomist, some biohackers track, empower, and dampen untapped veins of magical energy by using scientific and thaumaturgic catalysts.  
A ley line hacker does not have access to the basic boosters and basic inhibitors listed on page 42 of the Starfinder Character Operations Manual. Instead, they can use their biohacks to create ley line hacks, specialized grenades that create supernatural effects. These function as biohacks, except they cannot be injected into creatures; they are instead thrown weapons with the explode (5 feet) weapon property and a 20‑foot range increment. You can draw, activate, and throw a ley line hack as a standard action. A ley line hack’s effects last for a number of rounds equal to your key ability score modifier. If a ley line hack requires a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score.  
At 3rd level, you can increase the radius of a ley line hack to 10 feet (or to 15 feet at 15th level), after which you cannot increase the radius of additional ley line hacks until you have taken a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points. At 9th level, you can increase the radius twice in this way before resting to recover Stamina Points.  
You can create the following effects with a ley line hack:

-   Vines or other impediments cause creatures to take a –10‑foot penalty to their speeds (minimum 5 feet) for 1 round when they enter or begin their turn in the area.
-   Choose either a protective or exposing effect when using this ley line hack. Obstacles in the area bend reflexively. If the ley line hack is protective, increase any bonuses to AC and Reflex saves granted by cover in the area by 1. If the hack is exposing, decrease any bonuses to AC and Reflex saves granted by cover in the area by 1 (minimum +0).
-   Magical static suffuses the area. Any creature that enters or begins their turn in the area becomes off-target for 1 round (Fortitude negates), or nauseated for 1 round if they roll a natural 1 on their saving throw.

Choose one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. When a creature in the area takes damage of the chosen type (maximum once per round per creature), that damage increases by an amount equal to your biohacker level or your key ability modifier, whichever is lower.  
Ley line hacker replaces spark of ingenuity and the biohacker class features basic booster and basic inhibitor.

## Resonating Biohack

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 20_  
**Class** Biohacker  
  
Whereas most biohackers affect anatomy with injections, urogs’ crystalline physiology responds better to precise sonic resonances. An urog-trained biohacker can transform a living being’s composition with a word.  
Choose one of the following: advanced melee weapons, longarms, or sniper weapons. You’re proficient with weapons of the chosen type in the sonic category, and rather than the normal Weapon Specialization benefit for these weapons, you instead add half your character level to their damage. You can deliver injectable substances like poisons, serums, drugs, medicinals, and biohacks using sonic weapons as though they have the injection weapon special property and deal slashing damage. For any biohacker ability that functions with injection weapons, you can also apply that ability to a sonic weapon. At 2nd level, you gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls with these weapons. At 9th level the bonus increases to +2, and at 18th level it increases to +3. When you hit an ally with such a weapon, you can avoid dealing damage to that ally, while still affecting them with the biohack, drug, poison, serum, or other substance that was loaded into the injection weapon.  
Rather than using a syringe from your custom microlab to deliver biohacks, you instead use a handheld sonic pad that targets the EAC of an unwilling target but otherwise functions as a syringe. At 2nd level, you can use your custom microlab to direct a sonic burst at a creature within half your custom microlab’s range, affecting it with a biohack as if you had applied it with the sonic pad; this requires no attack roll, but an unwilling target can negate a biohack delivered this way with a successful Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your biohacker level + your key ability score modifier). This is a sonic effect.  
This replaces the injection expert class ability and the theorem gained at 2nd level.
