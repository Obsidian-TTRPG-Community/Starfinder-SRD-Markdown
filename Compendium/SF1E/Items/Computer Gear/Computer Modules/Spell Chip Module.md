# Spell Chip Module

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 215_  
**Price** 110% of component spell gem; **Type** Module  
It is possible to create spell gems (see page 224) in the form of chips that can be slotted into a computer system. A user capable of utilizing an equivalent spell gem with access to the computer in which such spell chips are installed can cast the related spells whenever controlling the computer and gains a +2 circumstance bonus to any skill check involving these spells. Spell chips cost 110% of a spell gem (page 224) with the same spells. When a spell is expended from a spell chip, the chip itself is not destroyed, and the spells can be reloaded into the spell chip for 90% of the normal price of a new spell chip.
