### DESCRIPTION

This bubbling amber serum is infused with special isotopes designed to absorb radiation from your body. Upon imbibing a _rad-out serum_, you can attempt a new saving throw against any radiation effects you’re affected by. If you succeed, the radiation effect automatically ends. In addition, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against radiation for 1 hour.
