## Description

You blast your target with the ripples of myriad realities, causing it to transform in unpredictable ways that are typically temporary. If the target fails its initial saving throw, roll on the Warpwave Effect table and apply the resulting condition, critical hit effect, or spell effect to the target. If the target is immune to this selected effect, roll a second time and apply the second effect instead (if it’s also immune to the second effect, it’s unaffected by the spell).  
The effects’ durations vary. Those effects marked with a superscript 1 are instantaneous, whereas those marked with a superscript 2 are effects for which the target can attempt a new saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect early. For effects marked with a superscript 3, each minute an affected creature can attempt a new saving throw to end that effect early. Unannotated effects follow their normal rules for duration. Except for baleful polymorph, a warpwave’s effects cannot be dispelled, but they can be removed by break enchantment, remove affliction, and any effect that specifically removes the imposed condition.
