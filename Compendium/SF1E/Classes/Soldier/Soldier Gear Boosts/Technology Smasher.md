# Technology Smasher 
(Ex; 11th Level)

When you use a weapon with the analog weapon special property to damage a technological object or creature with the technological subtype, your attack ignores that targetâ€™s hardness. If your weapon also has the archaic weapon special property, your attacks against technological objects and creatures with the technological subtype also deal additional damage to these targets equal to half your level.
