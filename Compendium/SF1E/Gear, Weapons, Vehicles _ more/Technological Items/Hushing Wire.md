# HUSHING WIRE

These rare items are bits of lost technology or unique items less powerful than artifacts. A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the item’s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.

### DESCRIPTION

This spool of monofilament wire is wrapped around a statuette of a stylized hand with an upraised index finger. The wire attaches to the base of the statuette and measures 20 feet long. You can only wrap the wire around a helpless, pinned, or willing creature that is Huge or smaller as a standard action. Once bound, the target has the entangled condition and can’t speak or make any other noise, even by knocking or slamming into objects. The first time each turn it attempts to do so, the hushing wire contracts around it, dealing the target 4d4 slashing damage. Another creature can unwind the wire as a full action to free the target; otherwise, the target must succeed at a DC 30 Acrobatics check to free itself.
