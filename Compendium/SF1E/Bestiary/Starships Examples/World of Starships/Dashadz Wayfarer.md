## Description

The Dashadz Wayfarer is an attempt to bridge the gap between military and civilian ships within the Veskarium. Based on schematics for a military transport vessel designed prior to the Pact Worlds-Veskarium alliance, this highly mobile craft is primarily utilized for transporting both goods and passengers across short distances. Though the Wayfarer lacks firepower by typical vesk standards, it’s been a hit with many solo explorers who prize the ship’s defensive capabilities and speed. As one of the first vesk-made vessels in widespread use in the Pact Worlds following the peace, the subsequent seven generations of Wayfarer have become emblematic of “safe” Veskarium ships in the eyes of their former foes. A few enterprising vesk and ijtikri tour guides operate profitable businesses out of their Wayfarers, offering affordable and scenic interplanetary tours of the Veskarium to Pact Worlds sightseers—though these jaunts are notorious for encountering trouble thanks to their pilots’ fearless stunts.  
 
The Wayfarer has unique quirks that endear it to enthusiasts while providing skeptics with plenty of ammunition for criticism. Originally a design flaw exacerbated by inconsistent construction, the gen-2 Wayfarer’s garbage ejection unit (page 18) doesn’t just eliminate waste
it violently blasts compacted cubes of detritus into space behind the starship. Early on, the company struggled to combat the barrage of jokes about the hair-trigger feature. However, by the third-generation model, Dashadz had embraced the ejection system, acknowledging it in still-popular advertisements that encouraged buyers’ mischievous sides—especially because it plays to vesk beliefs that anything can be a weapon.  
 
Hinged, removable bucket seats built into the Wayfarer’s expansion bays make the craft ideal for passenger transport, though smugglers sometimes use them to disguise secret compartments. While Dashadz insists the inclusion of makeshift hideaway compartments wasn’t intentional, Pact Worlds outlaws often purchase Wayfarers for this feature. Surprisingly, other Veskarium manufacturers have begun to incorporate Dashadz’s innovations into their own ship designs.
