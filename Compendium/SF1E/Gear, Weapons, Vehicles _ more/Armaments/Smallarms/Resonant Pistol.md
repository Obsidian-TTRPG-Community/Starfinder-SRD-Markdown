# RESONANT PISTOL
The crystalline structure inside a resonant pistol comes from the same synthetic material used in the resonant gauntlet. An electrical current can be directed through a long, conical barrel fitted with layers of the crystal, causing the material to reverberate with a devastating ultrasonic frequency. These weapons are noted for their ease of use, since they create no recoil. The only indication that these weapons have fired is a faint, high-pitched beep. Resonant pistols using a crystal lattice are more common and less expensive than those that contain a crystal matrix.

### SONIC WEAPONS

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
