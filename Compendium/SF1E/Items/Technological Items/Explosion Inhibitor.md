# Explosion Inhibitor

These rare items are bits of lost technology or unique items less powerful than artifacts. A relic has an item level but can be sold for 100% of the item’s price (like trade goods). A relic cannot be crafted without the means of a specific formula, which is almost always long lost, and often requires specific materials. A relic that became understood well enough to be reproduced, standardized, and mass-marketed might lose its relic status.

### Description

This 8-inch bronze ovoid has a single round button on its wide end. Activating the device is a swift action. For 1 round, the skin of the ovoid heaves and roils in waves that seem to be constantly falling in toward the ovoid and never rising out of it, yet the ovoid remains the same size. When an explosion or a weapon with the explode special property detonates within 30 feet of the explosion inhibitor, its explosion radius is halved (rounded down to the nearest increment of 5 feet, minimum radius of 5 feet). An explosion inhibitor can’t be harmed by explosives or weapons with the explode special property, regardless of the type of damage the explosion deals. An explosion inhibitor’s internal battery can’t be recharged by ordinary means, but when it’s within an explosion that deals at least 50 damage, it regains 1d6 charges, to a maximum of 10.
