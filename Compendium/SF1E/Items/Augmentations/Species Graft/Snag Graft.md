# Snag Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 147_  
**Item Level** 6;
**Price**::  4,400; **System** All Arms  
A feathery, fibrous material grows from the forelimbs of wrikreechees. This augmentation, made of either artificial or biotech substitutes, provides you with your own “arm baleen.” You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to attack rolls when attempting to grapple a creature smaller than yourself. As a full action, you can make two attempts to grapple such a creature with a –4 penalty to the attack rolls.
