  - name: "Hazardous Reality (Su)"
    desc: "An alorbidaemon can distort reality around themself. Each creature within 100 feet of the alorbidaemon must succeed at a DC 21 Will save or take a –2 penalty to saving throws against illusions; this penalty persists while the creature remains in the aura and for 1 minute afterward. Any creature taking this penalty also takes 4d10 damage at the end of each turn that they’re within an area of holographic terrain or within 30 feet of a [[Holographic Image]] (Will DC 21 negates), as the holographic threats attack them and inflict mental strain. A creature that succeeds at either Will save against hazardous reality is immune to that alorbidaemon’s aura for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect." 
  - name: "Virtual Mortality (Su)"
    desc: "As a standard action, an alucidaemon can focus on a single living creature within 60 feet that has immediate access to a personal comm unit or datapad. Unless the target succeeds at a DC 21 Will save, the device immediately activates a vidgame that compels the target to play it. While the vidgame is active, the target takes a –2 penalty to AC and saving throws. The target can take a move action to play the vidgame, allowing it to attempt another DC 21 Will save to end the effect. At the end of each turn that the target doesn’t take this move action, it begins to lose the vidgame and takes 3d8 damage from the vidgame as deadly feedback. Whether or not a creature succeeds at its saving throw against this ability, it’s immune to further instances of this effect for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect."

Originating from the desolate plane of Abaddon, daemons strive to end all life in existence—even destroying themselves after snuffing out or consuming every other soul. A daemon’s favorite method of killing often shapes their form and abilities. Traditional daemons might embrace more conventional means of inflicting death, though newer daemons have adapted to the galaxy’s evolving technology. Both alucidaemons and alorbidaemons prey upon those who lose themselves in digital media. The former drain the life from those who grow obsessed with vidgames. Especially dangerous, alorbidaemons arise from the souls of wicked sensates who perish while engrossed in virtual reality as their bodies withered from neglect.
Alucidaemons take the form of gaunt, child-like figures, their eyes covered by a visor feeding them various realities while they watch in slack-jawed awe. Nearly all of them move with the help of a floating pod that serves as an extension of their bodies
they control its movements with the mechanical gauntlets permanently locked onto their withered hands. Alorbidaemons appear as horrible amalgams of several alucidaemons, joined together in a connected set of pods to form a single body. A typical alucidaemon is 3 to 4 feet tall but weighs 200 pounds due to their mechanical components. A typical alorbidaemon is 4–5 feet tall but can weigh 1,000 pounds
