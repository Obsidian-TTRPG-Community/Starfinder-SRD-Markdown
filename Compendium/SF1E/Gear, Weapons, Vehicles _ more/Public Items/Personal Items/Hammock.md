### DESCRIPTION

A hammock is a portable bed made of netting that is suspended between two opposite points so that you can sleep above the ground. Metallic disks at either end of the hammock are magnetized and coated with a reusable adhesive, allowing them to be stuck on nearly any surface. Attaching or detaching the disks is a move action.
