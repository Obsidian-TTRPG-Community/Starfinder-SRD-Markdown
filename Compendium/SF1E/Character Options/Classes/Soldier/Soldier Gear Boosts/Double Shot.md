type:: Ex
source:: Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 26
desc:: As a standard action, you can perform a special double shot attack using a weapon with the quick reload property that does not target multiple creatures 
(Such as a weapon with the blast, explode, or line special property). The attack uses twice the normal amount of ammunition and increases the attack’s damage by 1 point per die of damage. This attack can’t benefit from the boost, guided, or variant boost weapon special properties, or any other ability or effect that is a move action and alters the effect of your attack or damage.
