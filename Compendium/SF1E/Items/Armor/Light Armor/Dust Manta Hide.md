# Dust Manta Hide

In Fullbright, some brave—or perhaps foolish—game hunters in the Outlaw Kingdoms pursue dust mantas for their desert-adapted hides, despite the inherent danger in doing so. Those fortunate enough to survive their hunts craft suits of light armor from the hides, using nanocarbon filaments to stitch the armor together.

The basic dust manta hide grants resistance to fire 5, and the advanced dust manta hide, fashioned from a dust manta monarch, grants resistance to fire 10. Both models also grant a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to hide in a desert environment.
