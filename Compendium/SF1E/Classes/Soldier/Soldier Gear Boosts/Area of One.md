You’re loath to waste good ammo on empty space; it’s more efficient to jam a barrel into your foe’s chest and fire. As a standard action while wielding a weapon that has the blast or line weapon special property, you can attempt a special combat maneuver check with a +4 bonus against a creature in your reach. Whether you succeed or fail, you can then fire the weapon at that creature as part of the standard action. If your combat maneuver succeeded, the ranged attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity, affects only that creature, and deals additional damage equal to your soldier level, and you treat the target as flat-footed against the attack.
