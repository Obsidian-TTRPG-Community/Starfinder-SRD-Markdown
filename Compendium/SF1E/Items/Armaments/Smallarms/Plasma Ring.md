# Plasma Ring

Plasma rings are relatively flat, circular weapons with an easily grippable interior, allowing them to be used in a variety of orientations. Plasma cycles through a channel within the ring at high speeds, and a release valve allows a stream of plasma to escape in a directed jet. Single-valve plasma rings produce a small discharge, while dual-valve plasma rings have a synchronized pair of valves to produce a larger discharge. Multichannel plasma rings build plasma in a series of parallel rings that vent into a single release valve for an extremely powerful blast.

### Plasma Weapons

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
