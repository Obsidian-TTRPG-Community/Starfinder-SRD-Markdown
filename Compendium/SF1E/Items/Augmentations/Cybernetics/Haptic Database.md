**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 143_  
**Level**:: 2
**Price**::  500 
**System**:: Hand  
The skin of one hand is lined with a thin layer of sensors that provide information about an object at a touch. You can identify a creature or object physically in contact with your hand using the guidelines of identify creature, identify technology, or identify magic item. You substitute your Perception modifier for the relevant skill modifier, and you can do this even if untrained. Having this augmentation counts as having access to an information network for the purposes of taking 20 on a check to identify a creature.
