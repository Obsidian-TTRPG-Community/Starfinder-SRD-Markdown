**Targets**:: one object of negligible bulk, or 5 UPBs  
**Duration**:: 1 round/level  
**Saving-Throw**:: Fortitude negates (object);

## Description

While you hold the touched object, it transmutes into tools you need for Engineering checks. This tool provides no bonuses to Engineering checks, but it prevents you from taking a penalty for lacking a tool. If the transmuted object leaves your grasp, it reverts to normal.
