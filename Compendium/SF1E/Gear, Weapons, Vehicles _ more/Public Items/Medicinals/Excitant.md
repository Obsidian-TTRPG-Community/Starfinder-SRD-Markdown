While stimulants provide a quick burst of energy, excitants provide a longer and more measured effect and are popular among soldiers on watch, though jitteriness is a common side effect. For a number of hours equal to the medicinal’s tier, you gain a bonus equal to the medicinal’s tier to saving throws to avoid becoming fatigued or exhausted, and you gain immunity to sleep effects. You take a –2 penalty to Dexterity-based skill checks for the duration of the medicinal. During this time, you do not need to attempt Fortitude saves to avoid the effects of sleep deprivation.
