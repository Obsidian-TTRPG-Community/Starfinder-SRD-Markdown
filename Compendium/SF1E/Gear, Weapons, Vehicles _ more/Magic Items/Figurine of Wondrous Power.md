Each _figurine of wondrous power_ is a statuette of a creature no more than a few inches tall and long. As a standard action, you can speak the figurine’s command word to transform the figurine into a creature in a space you can see within 30 feet of you. The figurine can’t change into a creature if it doesn’t have enough space to do so or if the environment can’t support the creature’s life functions. When the creature appears, it can act immediately on your turn. It understands and obeys your commands, and it understands Common but can’t speak. The creature considers your allies to be its allies and follows their orders when you aren’t able to give any.  
  
Each figurine in this entry can become a creature for up to 1 minute per day, though this duration does not need to be used continuously. After the figure has been in creature form for 1 minute, it reverts to figurine form and can’t be activated again for 24 hours. As a move action, you can dismiss the creature and return it to figurine form. The creature reverts to a figurine if killed. Although it can be healed while in creature form, the creature otherwise regains all its Hit Points 24 hours after its most recent activation. Therefore, if the creature is killed and reverts to figurine form, it can’t transform again for 24 hours.  
  
If you are within 30 feet of the creature when it returns to figurine form, the figurine appears in one of your empty hands or in your space (your choice). Otherwise, it reverts to figurine form as close to you as possible in its own space.  
  
A _figurine of wondrous power_ becomes nonmagical if broken, losing its power to transform into a creature.  

## Figurine of Wondrous Power, Bloodstone Bloodbrother

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 113_  
**Level** 13; **Price** 48,000; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

This figure of green stone mottled with red flecks can change into a bloodbrother. The bloodbrother starts with no creature in its rib cage prison and can’t deal Constitution damage, so it lacks fast healing. If the bloodbrother reverts to figurine form while a victim is in the bloodbrother’s rib cage prison, the victim is released in the bloodbrother’s space.

## Figurine of Wondrous Power, Plush Squox

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 49_  
**Level** 3; **Price** 1,500; **Bulk** L

### DESCRIPTION

This stuffed toy can turn into a trained squox (Alien Archive 2 118). Unlike most figurines of wondrous power, the figurine can transform into a squox for a total of 10 minutes per day, though the duration need not be used continuously and is expended in 1-minute increments. Wounds and damage received by the squox in its animate form translate to its figurine form when it reverts; if it dies, the plush figure appears torn and without stuffing. The plush squox does not heal in 24 hours as usual—you must repair the figurine using Engineering or an appropriate profession.

**Level** 5; **Price** 3,000; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

## FIGURINE OF WONDROUS POWER, POLYMER VELOCIRAPTOR

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 49_  
**Level** 6; **Price** 4,250; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

This plastic miniature, though expertly painted and shaded with acrylics to look like a primeval creature, could easily be mistaken as some game piece for a strategy game. You can transform it into a dromaeosaurid (Alien Archive 2 38). It behaves toward you much like a family pet, defending you fiercely.

## FIGURINE OF WONDROUS POWER, BONE CREST-EATER

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 113_  
**Level** 8; **Price** 9,000; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

This bone statuette can change into a crest-eater. The creature prefers to remain close to you, and if it has no other orders and can do so safely, it moves next to you.

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 49_  
**Level** 11; **Price** 25,000; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

This crude statue of milky‑gray metal can transform into your choice of a male or female hashukayak (Alien Archive 2 72), chosen when you activate the item. It’s agreeable and allows other creatures to ride it.

## FIGURINE OF WONDROUS POWER, DIAMOND LASER WOLF

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 49_  
**Level** 14; **Price** 65,500; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

Beautiful and expensivelooking, this canid statue transforms into a tashtari alpha (Alien Archive 2 124). The tashtari alpha can’t use its bristle nova ability unless its figurine has been exposed to at least one continuous hour of sunlight in the past 24 hours.

## FIGURINE OF WONDROUS POWER, PLASTIC SHARPWING

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 113_  
**Level** 15; **Price** 100,000; **Bulk** —

### DESCRIPTION

This figurine is an authentic plastic replica of the sharpwing into which it can transform. This sharpwing cannot lay eggs, so it cannot use its ovitonomy ability.
