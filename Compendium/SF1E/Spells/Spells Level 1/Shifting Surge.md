## Description

You touch a willing creature and affect one of its energy damage attacks or weapons, changing the energy damage type of one of its attacks to one other type until the end of your next turn. Even if you donâ€™t change the damage, the next affected attack that hits deals 2d6 additional damage if it targets only one target, or 1d6 additional damage if it affects an area or multiple targets.
