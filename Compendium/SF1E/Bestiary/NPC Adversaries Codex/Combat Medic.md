# Combat Medic

Military training hones experts with varied skillsets, tempering them in battlefield conditions. Mercenary work is an obvious outlet for their skills, but former military pros function well as security forces and rescue teams, and on exploration missions and supply delivery in dangerous areas. They might be found in more mundane settings, such as corporate facilities or research labs, especially in places where people or facilities need extra protection. Each of these NPCs has the following ability.  
**Unit Tactics (Ex)** Before rolling initiative, the character can choose to roll twice and take the lower result, and an ally within 30 feet can roll their initiative check twice and use the better result. When the character successfully uses covering fire, the selected ally gains the circumstance bonus to AC against the next two attacks made against them by creatures in the character’s line of effect.

### Special Abilities

**Combat Medic (Ex)** When a combat medic exceeds a Medicine check DC by 5 or more, the combat medic can also perform the treat deadly wounds task on the target without spending additional time. If the check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the combat medic also applies their Intelligence modifier to the amount healed by treat deadly wounds, as normal.

## Description

A combat medic learns to perform emergency first aid on the battlefield—skills that transfer directly to paramedic roles in civilian situations. A combat medic is valuable to a fighting unit because, in addition to providing fire support, the medic can patch up allies and get them back into the fight or enable their retreat.
