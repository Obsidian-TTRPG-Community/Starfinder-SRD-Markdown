## Description

Compiler Enterprises (CompEnt) isn’t known for building starships with extreme firepower, but its latest design represents a major departure from that reputation. The company hasn’t officially acknowledged the dreadnought Those Who Are or addressed why it set off bristling with weaponry, but its construction suggests an alarming change in CompEnt’s mission.  
  
Those Who Are is massive, even for CompEnt. It showcases the company’s trademark ample cargo space but, instead of customizable modular bays, boasts state-of-the-art shielding and armor, advanced weaponry, and housing for hosts of passengers. Lumbering at slow speeds and carrying a cannon designed to assault planetoids, Those Who Are seems built for wartime endurance and little else.  
  
The most popular rumor as to the ship’s purpose is that the Those Who Become anacites crafted it to seek out and avenge their own missing spacecraft. Others suggest that Those Who Become discovered a terrible threat outside the galaxy and designed their warship for when that nebulous enemy arrives. It’s also possible the ship is designed to wipe out other planets’ settlements and forcibly colonize those worlds.  
  
Realistically, CompEnt likely custom-built the ship for another party. The ship’s name certainly lends credence to the existence of a new Aballonian faction, possibly one that adheres to the technological unity of Singularitism. Private organizations such as the Prophets of Kalistrade are also rumored to have ties to CompEnt, and certain political factions in Near Space, like the Veskarium, might appreciate the ship’s munitions.  
  
Despite these likely explanations, another unsettling rumor persists: that Those Who Become found the First Ones during their travels and, with the very foundations of their beliefs challenged, intend to wipe their creators from the galaxy in order to truly ascend.
