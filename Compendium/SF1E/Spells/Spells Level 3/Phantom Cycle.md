## DESCRIPTION

You conjure a motorcycle out of raw magic. This phantom cycle is only partially real, with a shadowy finish, dark trim, and tires of ghostly mist. Only you can pilot this cycle, although anyone can be a passenger. For every caster level you have above 6th, your phantom cycle gains a 5-foot increase in speed, a 50-foot increase to its full speed, and a 5-mph increase to its overland movement.
