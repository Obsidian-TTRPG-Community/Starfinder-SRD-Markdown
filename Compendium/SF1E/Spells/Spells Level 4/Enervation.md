## Description

You shoot a black ray at a target, making a ranged attack against the targetâ€™s EAC. If you hit, the target gains 2 temporary negative levels. Negative levels stack. If the target survives, it recovers from negative levels after a number of hours equal to your caster level (maximum 15 hours). An undead creature struck by the ray gains 10 temporary Hit Points for 1 hour.
