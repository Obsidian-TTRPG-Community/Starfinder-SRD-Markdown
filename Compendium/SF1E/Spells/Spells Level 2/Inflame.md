## Description

You make a melee attack against a single target’s EAC. If you hit, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or it is sickened and develops painful blisters and boils that last for the spell’s duration. If the target takes bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage while inflamed, the boils burst, dealing 4d6 acid damage to the target and all adjacent creatures; adjacent creatures can halve this damage with a successful Reflex save. Once the boils burst, the spell ends and the sickened effect continues until the end of the target’s next turn.
