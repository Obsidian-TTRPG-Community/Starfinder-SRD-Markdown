**Level** 1;
**Price**::  3; **Bulk** L

### Description

This small, clockwork navigational device hones in on mystical signals emitted by the _Starstone_ resting at the heart of Absalom Station, calculating the compass’s precise distance from and direction relative to the enigmatic font. While you are in the Pact Worlds system, this device lets you automatically know which direction Absalom Station is in relation to your current location, and it grants you a +2 insight bonus to Piloting checks when astrogating throughout the Pact Worlds system.
