## DESCRIPTION

The Kevolari Collective’s K-51 Sky Fisher is an attack and support spacecraft designed specifically for the Pact Worlds defensive fleet. This mid-range, single-seat interceptor and tactical-reconnaissance spacecraft saw extensive deployment throughout the Silent War with the Veskarium as well as the Swarm invasion. At the time, the Sky Fisher used a brand-new proprietary brand of horacalcum-based thrusters called the Jalison V-1710, designed to offer superb speed performance and exceptional maneuverability. These thrusters gave the Sky Fishers tremendous command of the battlefield, as they were able to easily match and often surpass the interceptors from the Veskarium and later the Swarm. The Sky Fisher’s reputation was such that Veskarium pilots considered it a mark of honor to have defeated one in battle, and frequently sought out one-on-one duels with Sky Fishers in hopes of achieving this honor, even when the Veskarium had overwhelming numbers in a given tactical combat encounter.  
  
The Sky Fisher’s enhanced maneuverability also enabled it to excel at close ground support, with pilots often skimming mere feet over infantry and mobile armor units in order to devastate entrenched enemies just ahead of major ground offensives. The Sky Fisher’s high-speed torpedoes made short work of even heavily armored Veskarium gun emplacements and Swarm tunnels, greatly contributing to the success of Pact Worlds ground forces. The distinct roar of its approaching horacalcum-based thrusters prompted cheers from Pact Worlds troops who knew it was plowing through the enemy ahead, and caused Swarm forces to scatter.  
  
The K-51 Sky Fisher was named after a Castrovelian aerial ambush predator, a flying squid-like creature infamous for floating transparently before descending on unsuspecting prey. Although the current Sky Fisher lacks its namesake’s aerial camouflage, early prototypes experimented with stealth technology that ultimately encountered too many design hurdles to implement cleanly. The same mounts originally intended for active camouflage were later repurposed to house supplemental thrusters, giving the Sky Fisher its edge in speed and maneuverability—though its top speed is so extreme that pilots often risk blacking out when testing the starship’s limits.  
  
The Sky Fisher remained in service for over 60 years of the Silent War and Swarm invasion. After the Swarm was repelled initially, innovative new single-pilot craft increasingly replaced these reliable ships, driving a secondary market of corporate entities and private citizens alike who still seek the decommissioned vessels. Small to medium-sized businesses frequently retrofit Sky Fishers with a Drift drive for use in courier services, while racing enthusiasts value the frame for challenging interplanetary endurance courses.
