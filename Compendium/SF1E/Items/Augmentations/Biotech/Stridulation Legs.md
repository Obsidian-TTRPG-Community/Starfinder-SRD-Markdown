# Stridulation Legs

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 57_  
**Item Level** 6;
**Price**::  3,900; **System** Legs  
A combination of springy, flexible joints and ridged leg plates provide you with cricket-like mobility and musicality. In addition to functioning as a musical instrument, as a move action you can create a chirping drone that lasts until the end of your next turn. You and allies within 30 feet gain sonic resistance 5 while you continue to drone, which you can sustain as a move action each round. The augmentation also provides you exceptional leaping ability, granting you a +8 enhancement bonus to Athletics checks when jumping.
