Emetics are used to purge ingested toxins before they enter the bloodstream. One round after ingesting an emetic, you must succeed at a DC 12 Fortitude save or become nauseated for a number of rounds equal to 1d10 minus the medicinal’s tier (minimum 1 round); you can voluntarily fail this saving throw. If you take an emetic during the onset period of an ingested poison or drug, you attempt your initial saving throw with a bonus equal to 5 + the medicinal’s tier. This bonus is reduced by 5 if you take the emetic after the initial onset period. You gain no benefit from the emetic if you remove or suppress the nauseated condition it causes.
