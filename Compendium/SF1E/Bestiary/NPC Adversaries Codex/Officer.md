# OFFICER
Military training hones experts with varied skillsets, tempering them in battlefield conditions. Mercenary work is an obvious outlet for their skills, but former military pros function well as security forces and rescue teams, and on exploration missions and supply delivery in dangerous areas. They might be found in more mundane settings, such as corporate facilities or research labs, especially in places where people or facilities need extra protection. Each of these NPCs has the following ability.  
**Unit Tactics (Ex)** Before rolling initiative, the character can choose to roll twice and take the lower result, and an ally within 30 feet can roll their initiative check twice and use the better result. When the character successfully uses covering fire, the selected ally gains the circumstance bonus to AC against the next two attacks made against them by creatures in the character’s line of effect.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Unit Command (Ex)** As a standard action, the officer can issue a command to a willing ally within 60 feet that can hear or precisely sense the officer. The target can take one standard action, one move action, or one swift action. A creature can’t benefit from this ability more than once per minute.  
**Unnerving Precision (Ex)** Once per round when an officer’s attack exceeds their target’s AC by 5 or more, the target becomes shaken for 1 round (Will negates, DC = 10 + the officer’s CR).
