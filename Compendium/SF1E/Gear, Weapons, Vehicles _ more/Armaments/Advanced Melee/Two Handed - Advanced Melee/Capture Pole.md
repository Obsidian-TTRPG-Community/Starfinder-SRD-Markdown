# CAPTURE POLE
Built to resemble an ancient pre- Gap weapon used to apprehend prisoners of war, a capture pole consists of a polearm with a twopronged robotic head that snaps shut when its center is pressed against a target during an attack. Designed to lock around a creature’s neck, each of a capture pole’s prongs are outfitted with armor-piercing syringes used to inject a creature with a substance, typically a sedative to make apprehension easier. This occurs on a successful attack roll for a melee attack or grapple combat maneuver. Capture poles are favored weapons among the drow, who use them to capture slaves and discipline their orc servants.
