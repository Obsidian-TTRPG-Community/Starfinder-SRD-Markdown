### Description

A rocket rifle is a longarm that uses mini-rockets as ammunition. The weapon and its ammunition are both quite expensive, but they make up for it in firepower. Rocket rifles came into heavy use at the onset of the war with the Swarm, often employed by daring soldiers on high-risk missions into Swarm strongholds.
