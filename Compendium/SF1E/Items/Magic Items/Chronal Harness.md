### Description

This set of loosely fitted bands worn across the torso sparkles faintly with crystallized matter from the Dimension of Time. The harness counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in light armor, taking up one upgrade slot. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll your initiative check after seeing the result and use whichever of the two results is higher. Each time you activate the harness per day, the Resolve Point cost increases by 1, cumulatively.
