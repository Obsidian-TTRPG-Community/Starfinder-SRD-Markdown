# Fluttering Heart

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 91_  
**Level**:: 8
**Price**::  8220 
**System**:: Heart  
Your heart has necromantic onyx implants that put your autonomous functions under limited conscious control, allowing you to make yourself look weaker than you actually are. As a full action, you can convincingly feign a display of meekness that lasts until you attack or perform some other hostile action (such as casting a harmful spell) or 10 minutes have passed, whichever comes first. During this time, hostile creatures attack other viable targets instead of you if any exist, though it is possible you might be included in area effects (foes don’t avoid targeting you, they simply prioritize other viable targets). Once you use your _fluttering heart_, you can’t use it again until you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.
