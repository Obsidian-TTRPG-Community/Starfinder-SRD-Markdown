### Description

A sleeping bag is two padded blankets that form an enclosed pouch for sleeping, with a zipper or other fastener along one side to allow easy access. Like blankets, sleeping bags are usually made from woven synthetic fibers, but they provide greater warmth and comfort than blankets.
