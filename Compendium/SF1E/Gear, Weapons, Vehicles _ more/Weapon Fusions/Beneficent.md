Effect: When you score a critical hit against a significant enemy with a weapon that has the _beneficent_ fusion, you gain one charge of beneficence. As long as you are wielding the same weapon, you can expend a charge of beneficence to cast either _remove affliction_ or _lesser remove condition_ as a spell-like ability, using the weapon’s item level as your caster level. You cannot have more than one charge of beneficence at a time, and you lose all charges of beneficence if you take a 10 minute rest and spend a Resolve Point to regain your Stamina Points or if you take an 8-hour rest and regain your daily-use abilities and spells. If the weapon with the _beneficent_ fusion has an item level of 14 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast _remove condition_. If the weapon has an item level of 19 or higher, you can instead use a charge of beneficence to cast _greater remove condition_. A weapon cannot have the _beneficent_ weapon fusion if it also has the _unholy_ or _wounding_ weapon fusions.
