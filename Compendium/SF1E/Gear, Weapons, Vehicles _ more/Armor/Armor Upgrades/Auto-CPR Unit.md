This device monitors your blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and temperature. When one or more of these vital signs falls below an acceptable level, the device administers aid, injecting you with stimulants and resuscitating you with a defibrillator as necessary. If you have 0 Hit Points and are dying, at the end of your next turn the auto-CPR unit attempts to stabilize you, attempting a Medicine check to administer first aid to stabilize you with a +5 total skill bonus. If you have a computer interface, you can have the computer control activate the auto-CPR unit to attempt first aid when you have the bleed condition, and you add the tier of the computer in the interface to the auto-CPR unit’s total Medicine bonus.
