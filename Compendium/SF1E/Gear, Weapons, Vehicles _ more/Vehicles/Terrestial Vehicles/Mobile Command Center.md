### DESCRIPTION

Mobile bases are designed to traverse unknown or unfriendly ground and set up a modular outpost to tend to local needs. They can be refitted for technical work, surveillance and prospecting, medical support, or a dozen other roles as needed, and can be swiftly packed up and refitted in the field. The built-in weapon systems are often removed if local wildlife and denizens aren’t expected to be hostile.
