### Description

The basic hoverchair model can hover up to 1 foot above the ground, allowing it to traverse stairs and low obstacles, as well as avoid surface obstacles like oil slicks. The antigravity technology in a basic hoverchair requires a firm surface, and the hoverchair can’t hover over surfaces that can’t support its weight (such as deep water). This model includes two utility gear slots and two easily accessible compartments that can each store up to 1 bulk worth of items.  
At the GM’s discretion, a disabled PC with limited mobility receives a hoverchair at no cost as part of character creation.
