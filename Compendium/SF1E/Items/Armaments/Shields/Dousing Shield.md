# Dousing Shield

**Source**:: _Near Space pg. 151_  
A dousing shield looks similar to a standard riot shield, though it is more often used in situations where the wielder is in danger of catching fire. While you are wielding a dousing shield, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the attack roll of bull rush combat maneuvers. With a series of reservoirs containing flame-smothering chemicals, a dousing shield also functions as a fire extinguisher, except that it can end only your own burning condition and you can activate it as a move action. If you are Large or larger, you must activate the fire extinguisher feature of the shield over 2 consecutive rounds to end the burning condition (requiring the use of 2 charges). The 20 charges of a dousing shieldâ€™s fire extinguisher can be replenished for 5 credits.
