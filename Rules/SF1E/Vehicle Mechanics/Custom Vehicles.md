# Custom Vehicles

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Vehicles play a crucial role in most modern societies. While mass manufacturers provide many reliable options, the galaxy’s near-infinite challenges call for constant innovation, begetting custom prototypes of every variety. This section provides rules for creating your own custom vehicles, designed for whatever your adventures demand!  

# Building a Vehicle

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Designing a new vehicle involves choosing the vehicle’s item level, which determines many of the vehicle’s base statistics. From there, apply several templates to adjust those statistics and make the vehicle fit your concept. Whatever you design, you can augment it further using the vehicle modifications on pages 80–83.  
The following provides an overview of the vehicle-design process, detailed further in the following pages.  

## Step 0: Vehicle Concept

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Before you start designing your vehicle, you should have a clear idea of what the purpose of this vehicle is. Is the vehicle a fast transport, a powerful gunship, or an invulnerable tank? Why was it designed? What task was it created to perform? Who created it? A racing vehicle designed by goblins will sport a very different set of abilities than a Veskarian assault tank.  

## Step 1: Array

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Choose the level of the vehicle, then locate and use the starting statistics in Table 3–1: Custom Vehicle Array.  

## Step 2: Vehicle Type Graft

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Choose and apply one of the vehicle type grafts based on your vehicle’s general shape, such as a cycle, flying vehicle, tank, or walker. Apply any adjustments that template provides. The vehicle type graft has a significant impact on your vehicle’s final statistics.  

## Step 3: Vehicle Size Graft

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Determine the vehicle’s size. Choose a vehicle size template and apply any adjustments to your starting statistics. Large vehicles have no adjustments, as Large is the default size for most vehicles. Small creatures sometimes use Medium vehicles.  

## Step 4 (OPTIONAL): Vehicle Origin Graft

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Is this custom vehicle created by a large corporation for wide distribution, a hand-made vehicle, or an experimental vehicle? You can choose one graft that best describes your vehicle and apply it.  

## Step 5 (OPTIONAL): Special Grafts

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
The templates in this section describe rarer types of vehicles, such as those that are built from scrap, designed for off-road travel, or include an auto-pilot. Apply up to two of these grafts if they help to describe your vehicle.  

# Step 1: Array

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
The following pages provide base statistics for creating your vehicle, such as AC, speed, and starting price. The level determines the item level of the vehicle and its base statistics, which are modified further in the subsequent steps. Record each of these statistics for the level of your vehicle.  
**Level:** The item level of your vehicle.  
**Price:** The base price of the vehicle; it is modified by further templates. Apply changes in the order you apply the templates, starting with Step 3.  
**Speed:** The vehicle’s base speed. Land vehicles can move only along the ground, air vehicles have fly speeds, and water vehicles have swim speeds.  
**EAC:** The vehicle’s Energy Armor Class.  
**KAC:** The vehicle’s Kinetic Armor Class.  
**HP:** The vehicle’s Hit Point total. Its Break Threshold equals half the vehicle’s Hit Points, unless otherwise stated by a template.  
**Hardness:** The vehicle’s hardness. Additional grafts can increase the hardness up to twice this starting value, though vehicle modifications like adamantine plating (page 80) can increase the hardness beyond this limit afterward. A vehicle’s hardness is always at least 5, even if a graft would reduce it below this value.  
**Collision Damage:** The vehicle’s base collision damage, which can be altered by grafts and later modifications.  
**Collision DC:** The vehicle’s base collision DC.  
**Modifiers:** The vehicle’s modifiers to Piloting checks and attack rolls, with a larger modifier to attack rolls listed in parentheses for when the vehicle is traveling at full speed.  
**Modification Slots:** The number of modification slots (page 80) the vehicle has.

## Other Statistics

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 76_  
Several other statistics, described below, are derived from grafts rather than the vehicle’s level.  
**Adjustments:** These are modifications to the vehicle’s statistics. **Cover:** The amount of cover the vehicle provides.  
**Passengers:** The number of passengers the vehicle can comfortably carry, in addition to the pilot.  
**Special:** Unique effects or prerequisites that apply to the vehicle. **Speed (Full):** The vehicle’s full speed, primarily determined by the vehicle type graft.

# Step 4 (OPTIONAL): Vehicle Origin Graft

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
While most vehicles are mass-produced after rigorous testing, the following arrays can help express prototypes or experimental vehicles that aren’t ready for mass production yet. They can also represent completely customized, hand-crafted vehicles that are unique in design.  

## Experimental

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
Created by mechanical artisans, these one-of-a-kind vehicles are an expression of their creators’ visions.  
**Adjustments:** Decrease price by 50%, increase modification slots by 1.  
**Special:** The vehicle must have been created by the experimental vehicle alternate class feature (page 22).  

## Factory-made

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
Most vehicles are factory-made, use standardized parts for a particular civilization, and are relatively easy to repair, but have little room for creative modification.  
**Adjustments:** Decrease price by 10%, decrease modification slots by 1 (minimum 1). While in an area where standardized parts are available (such as a major settlement), decrease repair costs by 10% and decrease repair time by 25%.  

## Prototype

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
Design prototype vehicles might represent secret technologies (potentially stolen), yet companies sometimes sell off old prototypes as collectors’ items after their associated technologies are refined, patented, and on the market.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 10%, increase modification slots by 1, increase repair time and repair cost by 20%.  

# Step 5 (OPTIONAL): Special Grafts

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
The following grafts can help specialize your vehicle. Apply up to two of these grafts.  

## All-terrain

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
Designed for off-road travel, these rugged vehicles withstand rough terrain, weather, and abuse like no other.  
  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 5%, decrease speed by 5 feet, decrease full speed by 25 feet, decrease attack modifiers by 1. When moving through difficult terrain, this vehicle treats every other space of difficult terrain as a space of normal terrain.  

## Amphibious

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
These craft travel just as easily on land or in water.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 10%. The vehicle becomes a land and water vehicle, gaining either a ground speed equal to its swim speed, or vice versa.  
**Special:** The vehicle must have the boat type graft (page 77) or any type graft that grants a land speed.  

## Armored

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
These robust vehicles are fitted with armored plates or shielding systems that allow them to withstand punishing conditions.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 20%, decrease speed by 10 feet, increase EAC and KAC by 2, increase Hit Points by 10%, increase hardness by 10%, increase cover by 1 step (partial cover becomes cover, cover becomes improved cover, etc.)  
**Special:** The vehicle can’t have the tank type graft.  

## Computer-assisted Controls

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 78_  
Your vehicle contains a limited virtual intelligence (page 163) that can control the vehicle for short periods of time.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 5%.  
**Systems:** The vehicle gains an autopilot with a Piloting bonus equal to 4 + 1-1/2 × the vehicle’s level.  

## Hover

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 79_  
Your vehicle’s movement is based on hover technology, achieving lift through powerful jets or antigravity fields. These vehicles are relatively fragile, as they need low overall mass to function properly.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 10%, increase speed by 5 feet, decrease EAC and KAC by 1, decrease Hit Points by 20%. The vehicle becomes a land and water vehicle and gains the hover trait to its speeds. It can hover up to 5 feet over surfaces and ignores difficult terrain.  
**Special:** The vehicle must have the boat type graft (page 77) or any type graft that grants a land speed.  

## Hybrid Aircraft

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 79_  
These vehicles operate just as effectively on the ground as they do in the air, whether they use extendable wings or jet propulsion.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 15%, increase speed by 10 feet, decrease EAC and KAC by 1, decrease Hit Points by 10%. The vehicle becomes an air and land vehicle, gaining either a land speed equal to its fly speed, or vice versa.  
**Special:** The vehicle must have a land speed or fly speed.  

## Junk

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 79_  
These vehicles are made of spare parts and discarded refuse, making for cheap (albeit unreliable) rides.  
**Adjustments:** Decrease price by 20%, decrease full speed by 50 feet, decrease Piloting modifier by 3, decrease attack modifiers by 1. The vehicle gains the broken condition when reduced to 75% of its Hit Points instead of 50%.  
**Systems:** The vehicle gains the Unstable Engine system.  
_Unstable Engine:_ Once the vehicle becomes broken, its engine explodes in 1d4 rounds (even if it’s been wrecked), dealing 1d6 fire damage in a 10-foot burst around the vehicle; this damage increases to 3d6 for anyone riding the vehicle. At 3rd level and every odd level thereafter, the burst deals an additional 1d6 damage (or an additional 2d6 damage to riders). Creatures can take half damage with a successful Reflex save (DC = the vehicle’s collision DC).  
**Special:** If you have access to inert electronic and mechanical junk, this graft instead reduces vehicle price by 50%. This requires at least 10 bulk of junk for a Medium vehicle. For each size category larger than Medium, multiply the junk required by 8.  

## Luxury

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 79_  
These vehicles are built for comfort and boast amenities like fully adjustable heated seats, chilled beverage holders, and premium sound systems.  
**Adjustments:** Increase price by 20%, increase attack modifiers by 1 (maximum +0).

**Adjustments:** Increase speed by 5 feet, decrease Hit Points by 10%, decrease hardness by 20%, decrease passengers by 50%. After recalculating speed, increase full speed by 25%.  

## Transport

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 79_  
These vehicles tend to be large and ponderous, but are capable of high speeds over long distances.  
**Adjustments:** Increase overland speed by 20%, decrease piloting modifier by 1, increase passengers by 100%.  

# Improving Vehicles

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 79_  
Sometimes an owner’s own level outpaces their trusty vehicle’s capabilities, and when modifications (pages 80–83) aren’t enough, it’s time for a retrofit that boosts the vehicle’s item level. This often increases the vehicle’s performance and defenses, providing a good way for PCs to keep their vehicle competitive in tactical combat and vehicle chases without having to build or buy a completely new vehicle. The process for upgrading a vehicle varies, depending on whether the vehicle is a custom creation using the rules presented earlier in this chapter, or whether the vehicle is a prebuilt vehicle, such as those found on pages 228–229 of the Core Rulebook. In either case, upgrading a vehicle by one level takes a number of days based on the vehicle’s size: Medium = 1 day, Large = 2 days, Huge = 3 days, Gargantuan = 5 days, and Colossal = 10 days.  
**Custom Vehicles:** Calculate the price of the custom vehicle as though its item level were one higher (plus any grafts you want to add as part of the upgrade). The cost of upgrading the vehicle equals the difference between this higher price and the vehicle’s current price. Upon completing the upgrade, recalculate the vehicle’s statistics using the new item level (plus any added grafts).  
**Prebuilt Vehicles:** Upgrading a prebuilt vehicle costs a number of credits equal to 50% of the vehicle’s current cost. The vehicle’s item level increases by 1, and its new price becomes the sum of its original price plus the cost of any subsequent upgrades. The vehicle’s EAC and KAC values each increase by 1; if the vehicle’s new level is divisible by 5, the EAC and KAC instead increase by 2 each.  
The vehicle gains additional Hit Points based on its new level. Increase the Hit Points by 10 if the vehicle’s new level is 4 or lower, by 15 if the new level is between 5–10, by 20 if the new level is between 11–15, or by 30 if the new level is 16 or higher. If the vehicle’s new level is 6 or higher, increase its hardness by 1. If the vehicle’s new level is divisible by 4, increase its speed by 5 feet, increase its full speed by 50 feet, and increase its overland speed by 20%.  
If the vehicle’s new level is divisible by 5, the vehicle gains an additional modification slot. As part of performing the upgrade, a PC can also remove or install any available vehicle modifications without increasing the total time required for the upgrade.
