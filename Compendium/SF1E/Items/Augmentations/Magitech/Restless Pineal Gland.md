# Restless Pineal Gland

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 93_  
**Level**:: 7
**Price**::  5500 
**System**:: Endocrine  
The melatonin produced by a _restless pineal gland_ is supercharged with mystic energy. You need only 2 hours of sleep each day and this allows you to regain daily-use abilities and slots, but you can't regain your daily abilities spell slots more than once per day. In addition, you gain a +4 enhancement bonus to saving throws against spells and other effects that would put you to sleep. Once per day, you can wake yourself from sleeping as a full action.
