### DESCRIPTION

This iridescent metal headband features an intricate rendering of a butterfly, resplendent with jeweled stars, suns, and moons on its wings. You can activate the headband as a reaction when you provoke an attack of opportunity, surrounding yourself in a momentary burst of starlight and butterfly wings that confounds your attackers, granting you concealment against any attacks your triggering action provoked. After resolving the attacks of opportunity, the light and butterflies dissipate, imparting an instantaneous vision of victories to come. Before the end of your next turn, you can declare that an attack, saving throw, or skill check you’re about to attempt was the subject of that vision. If your vision applies to an attack or saving throw, apply a +1 insight bonus to the roll. If the vision applies to a skill check, roll 1d4 and add the result as an insight bonus to the check’s result.  
After you activate the diadem, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.
