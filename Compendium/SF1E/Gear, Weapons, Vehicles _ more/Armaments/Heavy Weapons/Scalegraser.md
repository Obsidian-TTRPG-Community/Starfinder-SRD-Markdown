# SCALEGRASER
Designed to be smuggled into secure locations and overwhelm local defenses, the scalegraser is stealthy artillery that breaks into 31 components and uses innocuous batteries as ammunition. Its plasma bolts fragment on impact, causing unpredictable collateral damage, which is often the goal. The scalegraserâ€™s indiscriminate ordinance intimidates Aspis enemies and can incinerate evidence of Aspis crimes, making this a favorite weapon among cleaner crews.

### PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
