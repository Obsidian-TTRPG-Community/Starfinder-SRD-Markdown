Those suffering from substance addiction can take a dose of narco-imitator to suppress the penalties for addiction as if they had taken a dose of the drug to which they are addicted. A narco-imitator must be formulated for a specific drug. You do not gain the benefits of the drug but do suffer any drawbacks. While taking narco-imitators, you can attempt saves to cure addiction as though you were not taking the drug at all with a bonus equal to the medicinalâ€™s tier.
