### DESCRIPTION

A framework of metal ribs covers this suit of heavy armor. Force fields bridge the gaps between the metal ribs, which give the armor the macabre look of a metal skeleton. Officers of the Corpse Fleet favor this armor for its unsettling appearance, but steelbones can be worn by anyone who values an intimidating style.
