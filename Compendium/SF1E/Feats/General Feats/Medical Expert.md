Benefit: You can use the Medicine skill in conjunction with a medpatch or sprayflesh to treat deadly wounds as a full action (DC 25). If you have an ability that enables you to treat deadly wounds more often but with a longer time frame (such as the envoy’s surgeon expertise talent), you cannot use this feat to use that ability more quickly. When used in this way, the medpatch or sprayflesh does not perform any of its normal functions. You can also use the Medicine skill to provide long-term care with just a medkit.
Prerequisites: Life Science 1 rank, Medicine 1 rank, Physical Science 1 rank.

**Prerequisites**: Life Science 1 rank, Medicine 1 rank, Physical Science 1 rank.

**Benefit**: You can use the Medicine skill in conjunction with a medpatch or sprayflesh to treat deadly wounds as a full action (DC 25). If you have an ability that enables you to treat deadly wounds more often but with a longer time frame (such as the envoy’s surgeon expertise talent), you cannot use this feat to use that ability more quickly. When used in this way, the medpatch or sprayflesh does not perform any of its normal functions. You can also use the Medicine skill to provide long-term care with just a medkit.

**Normal**: It takes 1 minute to treat deadly wounds, and longterm care requires a medical bay or medical lab.
