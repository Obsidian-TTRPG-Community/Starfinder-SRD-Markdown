## DESCRIPTION

You create a spiritual link between a weapon you touch and one target you can perceive with a precise sense at the time of casting. The next attack made with that weapon against that target (as long as it is within 1 minute) ignores cover and concealment. If the attack is a ranged attack, it does not need a line of effect as long as some route exists between the weapon and the target (regardless of how circuitous that route is). The attack is subject to the normal penalties from range increments.
