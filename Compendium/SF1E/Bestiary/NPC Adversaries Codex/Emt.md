# Emt

In many societies, practicing medicine requires extensive (and often formal) education and even certification. Yet the galaxy is a big, dangerous place, and some of the best healers are self-taught, work outside of official networks, or both. Altruism, prestige, or profit motivate most medics to provide life-saving care. However, medics can be villains, with criminals, charlatans, and unethical innovators willing to provide risky surgeries, experimental drugs, or cure-all placebos for the right price.

### Special Abilities

**Injection Weapon Training (Ex)** An EMT gains a +5 circumstance bonus to attack rolls using weapons with the injection special property when attacking a willing target. On a successful attack with an injection weapon against a willing target, the EMT can choose to deal no damage to the target while still affecting the target with any drug, serum, or similar substance loaded into the injection weapon.

## Description

Emergency medical technicians (sometimes abbreviated as EMTs) are often first on the scene, providing field care and stabilizing seriously injured patients for transportation to a medical facility for more intense procedures. Although not included in their gear, EMTs typically operate with an ambulance, such as a hover truck with a medical lab expansion bay.  
The stats presented here also work well for a medic early in their career, such as a doctor in residency or self-trained street clinician. This could also represent a criminal, such as an organ thief.
