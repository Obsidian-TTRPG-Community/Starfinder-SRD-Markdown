Benefit: As a full action, you show off your physical prowess in a dazzling or terrifying display. Attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within 30 feet of you, applying the check’s result separately to each creature and its DC to demoralize. If your display is dazzling, each creature you successfully demoralize is fascinated by your strength for 1d4 rounds rather than shaken. If your display is terrifying, each creature you successfully demoralize is shaken for 1 round (even if your check result would normally increase the duration of the shaken effect). Once you’ve successfully affected a creature with either display, they’re immune to this feat for 1 hour. This is a sense-dependent ability.
Prerequisites: Str 15, Intimidate 5 ranks.
