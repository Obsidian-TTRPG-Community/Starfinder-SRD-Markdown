## Mech Bay

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 28_  
**PCU**:: 15
**Cost (in BP)**:: 15  
A mech bay takes up two expansion bays and can be installed only in a Large or larger ship. It can store 4 Huge mechs, 2 Gargantuan mechs, or 1 Colossal mech. While a mech is housed in a mech bay, repairs on it take half the time and shield regeneration is twice as fast. Mechs can be deployed from the bay directly to a planetâ€™s surface if the ship is landed, or they can be loaded into an available drop pod (Starship Operations Manual 25) or sky crane (page 29).
