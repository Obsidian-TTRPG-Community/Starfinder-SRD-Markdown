As a swift action, you can deploy or undeploy these foils to increase your flight maneuverability from clumsy to average or from average to perfect. Additionally, you can deploy these gliders while falling to slow your descent to 60 feet per round and move horizontally at a rate of 5 feet for every 1 foot you fall. While the glider foils are deployed, your maximum Dexterity bonus to AC is reduced by 2 (to a minimum of 0). The glider foils have no power of their own and don’t allow you to gain altitude.
