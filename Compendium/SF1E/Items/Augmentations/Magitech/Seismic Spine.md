# Seismic Spine

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 85_  
**Level**:: 20
**Price**::  1075000 
**System**:: Spine  
A _seismic spine_ gives you resistance 15 to electricity damage and sonic damage. Once per day as a standard action, you can stomp the ground or otherwise create percussion, such as by clapping your hands, to unleash a shockwave from your _seismic spine_. Creatures and objects within a 20-foot-radius spread of you take 10d6 electricity and sonic damage (Fortitude save for half damage; DC = 10 + half your character level + your Constitution modifier). A creature that fails the saving throw is knocked prone. If a technological construct fails the save, the construct is also stunned for 1 round even if it is normally immune to being stunned. Unattended hybrid or technological objects in the area cease functioning for 1 round. Once you have used your _seismic spine_, you can do so again only after you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, and you must spend 1 Resolve Point to use your _seismic spine_ each time after the first time per day.
