Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a single attack with a weapon that deals sonic damage and uses charges; this attack uses three times as many charges from the battery or power cell as normal. In addition to your normal weapon effects and damage, all creatures within 20 feet of the target must attempt a Fortitude save with a DC equal to 10 + 1/2 the weapon’s item level + the ability modifier you applied when making the attack with that weapon. Any creature that fails the save and possesses blindsense (sound or vibration) or blindsight (sound or vibration) is unable to use those abilities until the beginning of your next turn.
