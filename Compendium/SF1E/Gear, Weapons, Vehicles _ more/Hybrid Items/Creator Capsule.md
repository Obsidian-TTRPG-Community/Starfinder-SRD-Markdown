# CREATOR CAPSULE
Although it appears to be little more than an oblong case full of electronics, a _creator capsule_ is a tiny 3D printer, with a programmable interface and a supply of UPBs stored in an extradimensional space. As a full action, you can connect the _creator capsule_ wirelessly to your comm unit or computer, then command it to print one or more nonmagical personal or technological items. Printing an item requires you to have the plans on the connected device or an infosphere connection through which you can download the blueprints.  
  
A _creator capsule_ takes 1 round to create an item, plus 1 round per bulk of the item above light. No individual printed item can have a bulk greater than 3. The _creator capsule_ consumes itself during the printing process. Although the printer can be stopped as a move action, doing so renders the capsule useless for further printing. An item printed by the _creator capsule_ is of average quality, and it has the statistics of an ordinary item of its type.  
  
Based on its type, a creator capsule has the following cost and level limits on items it creates.
