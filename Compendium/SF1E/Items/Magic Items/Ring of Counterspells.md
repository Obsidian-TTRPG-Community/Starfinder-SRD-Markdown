### Description

Spell duels are traditional in cultures throughout not only the Pact Worlds but the entire galaxy. A wily duelist might wear a _ring of counterspells_ to foil one of an opponent’s tricks, though these rings also work well against enemies who employ predictable offensive magic.  
  
A spellcaster can target a _ring of counterspells_ with a spell. That spell has no effect other than being stored in the ring. While you wear the ring, if you would be a target of the spell stored in the ring, the spell fails and has no effect. This countering is automatic; it requires no action or awareness on your part. Once the ring counters a spell, the stored spell dissipates, and the ring can’t counter a spell until another is stored within it.
