desc:: With a practiced swing, you expend all your weapon’s power into one strike. When you successfully use a melee weapon with the powered weapon special property to strike a target, you can expend all the weapon’s remaining charges to deal additional damage, after which the weapon deactivates. The amount of additional damage is equal to 1d4 for every 3 item levels the weapon has and the number of additional damage dice cannot exceed 1/3 of your Soldier level. If the weapon has at least half of its charges remaining, the additional damage die size increases to d6s.
