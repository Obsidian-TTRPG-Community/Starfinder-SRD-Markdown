# Metaphysical Detector

This one-handed device can be held in front of you and activated as a swift action. The MPD indicates the distance to the closest entity with the trait determined by its style below. The MPD has a range of 100 feet and doesnâ€™t indicate a direction, so you must move around to triangulate a specific location. Since it detects only the closest creature, it can be confused by multiple entities.
