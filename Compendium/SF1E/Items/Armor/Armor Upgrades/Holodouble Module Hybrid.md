# Holodouble Module (HYBRID)

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 83_  
**Item Level** 10;
**Price**::  18,000  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Light, Heavy; **Bulk** —  
**Capacity**:: 10; **Usage** 1/round  
This magitech device scans your body so accurately that it can project a holographic double. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24 hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for 24 hours. As a move action, you can create a double (as _mirror image_) that lasts until you spend another move action to deactivate the device or it runs out of charges. No more than one double can be active at the same time. A _holodouble module’s_ charges replenish each day.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
