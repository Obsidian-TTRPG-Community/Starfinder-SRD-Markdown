TACTICS

**During Combat** A bil’djooli hunter-killer attempts to snipe from cover and use hit and run tactics supported by their cloaking fields to bring down prey. Unlike most bil’djooli of higher ranks, a hunter-killer does not mind getting their tentacles dirty.

**Morale** A bil’djooli hunter-killer attempts a coordinated retreat when dropped below 50 Hit Points. Specially bred and trained for combat, a bil’djooli hunter-killer does not surrender, except in the most desperate of circumstances.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### Contamination (EX)

As a bil’djooli elite soldier, but the save DC is 21.

#### Glimpse the Truth (EX)

This functions as the operative exploit of the same name, save that the bil’djooli hunter- killer may use it five times per day before requiring an 8–hour rest to use it again.

#### Jet (EX)

As a bil’djooli elite soldier.

#### Phase Shift Escape (EX)

A bil’djooli hunter-killer can move through solid matter by converting their matter into out of phase energy for just a moment. As a full action, the bil’djooli can phase through up to 10 feet of solid matter, leaving a clearly visible black stain. This otherwise functions as the operative specialization power of the same name.

ABOUT

Bil’djooli hunter-killers are deadly assassins that specialize in quickly and efficiently taking down foes. If a target is too powerful to swiftly eliminate, they engage in pursuit predation tactics, interrupting rests and striking when their prey is vulnerable.
