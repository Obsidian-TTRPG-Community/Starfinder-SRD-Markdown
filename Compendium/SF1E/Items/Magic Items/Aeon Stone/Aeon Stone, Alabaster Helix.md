**Price**::  30000
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

Rumor says the first _alabaster helix_ originated on a hidden world somewhere in the Vast. This _aeon stone_ must adjust to your physiology by orbiting you for 24 hours. If the stone stops orbiting you for more than 1 minute, it must readjust to you. The stone can orbit you while you’re prone or unconscious, but it stops orbiting you if you die. While the _alabaster helix_ orbits and remains adjusted to you, you regain 1 Hit Point per hour. You can have only one _alabaster helix_ adjusted to your physiology at a time.
