# PUBLIC ITEMS & SERVICE

Beyond weapons, armor, and crucial technological, magical, and hybrid equipment, explorers and adventurers need food, clothing, survival supplies, and other basic gear. Characters can also spend their hard-earned credits on lodging, services, and transportation. The equipment and services in this section are not considered technological or magical unless they specify otherwise.
