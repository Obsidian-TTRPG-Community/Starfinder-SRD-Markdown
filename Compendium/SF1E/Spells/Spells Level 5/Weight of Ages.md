## Description

You burden the targets with all the aches, pains, and sorrows of a lifetime. The targets take 10d8 damage and become encumbered for the duration, or they become overburdened if already encumbered. Each target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the damage dealt by this spell and negate the encumbered condition.
