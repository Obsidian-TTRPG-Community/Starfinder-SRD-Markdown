### Description

The hot springs of Ouat Vali impart exceptional—potentially even permanent—vitality to bathers. Even water removed from its source and kept in carefully insulated vials provides some benefits, functioning in many ways like a magical serum. Drinking a vial of Vali water grants the imbiber a +1 insight bonus to attack rolls, skill checks, and saving throws their abilities’ and spells’ saving throw DCs increase by 1 and they gain 1 temporary Resolve Point. After 1 hour, these effects end, the Resolve Point (if not already spent) disappears, and the user becomes fatigued. Drinking more than one vial of Vali water in a 24-hour period is dangerous, dealing 10d10 damage and giving the imbiber the paralyzed condition for 6d10 minutes unless they succeed at a DC 25 Fortitude save.  
Genuine Vali water is exceedingly rare, as export is strictly prohibited by the Maratan government, and black markets are rife with counterfeits that range from merely useless to actively harmful.
