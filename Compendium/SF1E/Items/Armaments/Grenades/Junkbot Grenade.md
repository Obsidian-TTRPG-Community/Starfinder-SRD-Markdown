### Description

When you use a _junkbot grenade_, you set it to either handy or healing, then throw it into a pile of inert technological equipment of at least 1 bulk. When the grenade lands, it spreads magical nanites over the blast radius. Over the course of the next round, the nanites convert the junk into a _handy junkbot_ or _healing junkbot_, as those spells except as detailed here. Either spell has a caster level of 9th. You must command the junkbot verbally. The junkbot created from this effect lasts for 1 minute.
