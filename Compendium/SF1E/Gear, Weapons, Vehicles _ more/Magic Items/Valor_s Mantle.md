### DESCRIPTION

Popular among the Knights of Golarion but proudly worn by other followers of Iomedae and by unaffiliated warriors, these carmine red short cloaks, shawls, or scarves proudly advertise their wearer’s courage. The garment counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. The mantle grants you a +2 divine bonus to saving throws against fear effects.
