### Special Abilities

**Devil Starship (Ex)** A volocoth is a living creature so immense it functions as a starship (and thus engages only in starship combat). It has no crew, but it can still take engineer, gunner, pilot, and science officer actions using the skill bonuses, ranks, and level listed above. Modifiers for its size, speed, and maneuverability have already been factored into its statistics. Use the following table to determine the effects when a volocoth takes critical damage.

| D%     | SYSTEM     | EFFECT                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–10   | Head       | Condition applies to gunner actions using the turret.                                                                                                                            |
| 11–40  | Maw        | Condition applies to gunner actions using weapons in the forward arc. If this system is malfunctioning or worse, the volocoth can't hold a starship with its serrated mandibles. |
| 41–70  | Core       | Condition applies to all engineer actions, except when patching or repairing the core.                                                                                           |
| 71–100 | Propulsion | Condition applies to all pilot actions.                                                                                                                                          |


  
  
**Hellfire Plating (Ex)** A volocoth gains a +2 bonus to its AC and TL against direct-fire weapons with “laser” in the name and weapons with the smoldering special property (Near Space 115). After being successfully hit by a smoldering weapon, the volocoth takes no additional damage the following round.  
**Serrated Mandibles (Ex)** A volocoth can use its serrated mandibles only against a ship in an adjacent hex. If the volocoth deals damage with this attack to a ship of its size or smaller, it holds that ship in place. As an action, the pilot of the held starship can attempt a DC 24 Piloting check to break free of the jaws. While holding a starship in its mandibles, the volocoth can’t move, turn, or use weapons in its forward arc except to attack the held ship. The volocoth and the ship it’s holding take a –2 penalty to AC and TL, and to Piloting checks to determine movement order during starship combat.

## Description

The insectile body of this enormous, flying devil is fronted by a formidable maw with wicked, serrated mandibles. Atop the body, like the forecastle of a nautical ship, is a swiveling beacon of flaming light that channels the fires of Hell. Ships caught in the crush of the volocoth’s mandibles are at greater risk from the attacks of the volocoth’s allies. Capable of carrying a small squad of smaller devils within, void devils are often used as assault vehicles for infernal raids on other planes.
