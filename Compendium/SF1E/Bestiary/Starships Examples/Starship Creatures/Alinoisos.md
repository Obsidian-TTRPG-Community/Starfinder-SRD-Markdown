# Alinoisos

N Medium starship outsider, **Tier** 13
**Speed** 8; **Maneuverability** good (turn 1); **Drift** —  
**AC** 27; **TL** 24  
**HP** 340; **DT** —; **CT** 68

**Gunners (4 actions)** gunnery +19 (13th level)  
**Pilot (1 action)** Piloting +29 (13 ranks)  
**Science Officer (1 action)** Computers +23 (13 ranks)

### Ecology

**Environment** any vacuum  
**Organization** solitary

### Special Abilities

**Gravitational Adjustment (Ex)** Every 1d4 rounds, just before or after it moves during the helm phase, an alinoisos can push or pull a starship to an empty hex either further away or closer.  
  
**Living Starship (Ex)** An alinoisos is a spacefaring aeon so immense that it functions as a starship (and thus engages only in starship combat). It has no crew, but it can still take engineer, gunner, pilot, and science officer actions using the bonuses, level, and ranks listed above. Modifiers for its size, speed, and maneuverability are already factored into its statistics. Use the following table to determine the effects when an alinoisos takes critical damage.

| D%     | SYSTEM        | EFFECT                                                                                                            |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–30   | Weapons array | Randomly determine one arc containing weapons; condition applies to all gunner actions using weapons in that arc. |
| 31–60  | Propulsion    | Condition applies to all pilot actions.                                                                           |
| 61–90  | Heart         | Condition applies to all engineer actions, except when patching or repairing the heart.                           |
| 91–100 | Brain†        | During the next round, each of the alinoisos’s attempted actions has a 25% chance of failure.                     |


† An alinoisos’s brain doesn’t gain critical damage conditions.

## Description

An alinoisos is a nebulous aeon tasked with maintaining the balance between light and gravity, and it attempts to neutralize any imbalances it perceives by any means necessary and with no concern for ethics or morality.  
  
An alinoisos travels the multiverse in search of imbalance, and might focus on such things as a megastructure that saps the energy from a star it encompasses, an advanced civilization that has discovered technomagical means of manipulating gravity, or even starships whose gravity-bending weapons happen to catch the aeon’s attention. The outsider then neutralizes these perceived threats, whether through destruction or its ability to manipulate gravity. Because alinoisoses share similar concerns with solarians, the rare alinoisos is sometimes revered as a near-mythical mascot of sorts by remote solarian enclaves, which imprint its likeness onto their armor, banners, and architecture.
