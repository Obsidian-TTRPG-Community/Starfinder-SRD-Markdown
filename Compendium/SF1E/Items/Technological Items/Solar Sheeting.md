### Description

When you take a full action to unfurl this thin, 5-foot-square black panel, it absorbs solar energy and converts it into power, acting as a recharging station. In direct sunlight, it takes solar sheeting 10 minutes to recharge 1 charge in a battery or power cell. In overcast daytime conditions, it takes 1 hour per charge restored.
