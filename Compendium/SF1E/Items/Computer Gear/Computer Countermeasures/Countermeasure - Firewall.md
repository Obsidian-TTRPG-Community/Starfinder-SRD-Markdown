# Countermeasure - Firewall

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 215_  
**Price** 20% of computer's base price; **Type** Countermeasure  
This countermeasure does nothing to the intruder but instead partitions off modules behind an additional layer of security. Accessing the hidden modules requires another successful Computers check, usually with a DC equal to the original DC + 2. A computer can have multiple firewalls to block off multiple modules, but no one module can be protected by more than a single firewall. A firewall costs 20% of the base price of the computer.
