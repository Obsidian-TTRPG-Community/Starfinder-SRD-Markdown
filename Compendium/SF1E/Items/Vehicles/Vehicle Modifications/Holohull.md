A series of advanced holographic projectors enable a vehicle with a holohull to rapidly change its paint job and minor detailing, though it cannot obscure the vehicle’s shape or major features. A pilot or passenger can spend 1 minute to program or reprogram the holohull with up to four different designs, each of which can feature a wide range of colors, designs, and iconography. As a swift action, the vehicle’s pilot can activate the holohull to change the vehicle’s appearance to any of the four designs.
