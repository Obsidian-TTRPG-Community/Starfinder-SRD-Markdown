While technological medical equipment and magical healing are readily available for purchase in most areas, many people have neither the funds nor the skill to use such methods. Fortunately, three types of facilities provide medical treatment services to the general public: clinics, hospitals, and trauma centers. Each of these facilities is usually equipped with multiple medical labs and can perform some or all of the tasks of the Medicine skill, detailed below. Prices depend on the service provided, as listed in Table 1â€“34, though most facilities will perform first aid for no cost. These are average prices; medical treatments at a high-end or luxury facility can cost 2 to 10 times more.

Clinics are small outpatient facilities that provide only basic medical treatments: first aid, treat deadly wounds, treat disease, and treat drugs or poison. Hospitals are larger institutions that offer all medical treatments and include room and board for the duration of your stay. Trauma centers provide emergency care for traumatic injuries and can offer the following medical treatments: first aid, treat deadly wounds, long-term stability, and treat drugs or poison.

An average doctor at a clinic is a CR 6 expert with Life Science and Medicine as master skills (+16 skill bonus for both), while a typical doctor at a hospital or trauma center is a CR 7 expert with a +19 skill bonus in Life Science and Medicine.
