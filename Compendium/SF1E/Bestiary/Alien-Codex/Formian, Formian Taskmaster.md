# Formian, Formian Taskmaster

## Formian

**Source**:  _Alien Archive pg. 50_  
Formians resemble giant ants with humanoid upper bodies, and carve their chitinous plates with insignias reflecting their individual names and achievements. Members of a hive all share a telepathic link, allowing them to coordinate efficiently. Within a hive are castes specialized to particular tasks. The queen leads the hive and is its sole means of propagation, while castes like the aristocratic myrmarchs and mercantile taskmasters direct lower castes like warriors and workers. Formians are most common on Castrovel. For millennia they sought to eradicate the lashunta, their traditional foes, but their queens now instead focus on adopting other species’ technology to industrialize their traditional hive societies.

### Special Abilities

**Hive Mind (Ex)** Formians operate from a shared hive intelligence that allows them to communicate nearly instantaneously. While within telepathic range of at least one other formian with this ability, a formian gains a +4 bonus to initiative and to Perception checks. If one formian is aware of a combatant, all members of the hive mind within range are aware of it, and a member of the hive mind cannot be surprised unless all members within range are surprised. If one member of the hive mind succeeds at a Will save to disbelieve an illusion effect, all members of that hive mind within telepathic range also disbelieve the effect.

**Mental Motivation (Su)** As a move action, a taskmaster can inspire all other formians from the same hive within range of its telepathy, granting them a +2 morale bonus to attacks, skill checks, and saves against charm and fear effects for 1 minute. A creature can be affected by only one taskmaster’s mental motivation ability at a time.

**Track** Dexterity; **Frequency** 1/round for 6 rounds

## Description

Formian taskmasters and myrmarchs each serve highly specialized roles within their hive-organized species. Taskmasters are typically 5 feet tall and weigh 300 pounds, while myrmarchs average 8 feet in height and weigh around 1,200 pounds.

Formian taskmasters play a mercantile role and often represent formian interests abroad. Formian myrmarchs are almost never seen outside of the hive. These aristocratic members of formian culture are the queen’s agents and advisors, generals of formian armies, and leaders of complex civic projects. They are deadly combatants, but their real power comes from their ability to elicit extraordinary performance from the entire hive.
