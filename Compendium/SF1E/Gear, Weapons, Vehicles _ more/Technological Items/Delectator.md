### DESCRIPTION

This virtually indestructible 1-quart thermos comes in a variety of attractive designs and features patented temperature control technology. When activated, the device senses its contents’ temperature and maintains that temperature to a minimum of 10° Fahrenheit and maximum of 150° Fahrenheit.  
You can expend an additional charge and activate the delectator’s secondary function as a standard action, causing it to subtly and temporarily realign molecules to change the contents’ flavor for 15 minutes or until the contents have been out of the device for one minute. While the delectator can easily cause water to taste like beer or bland oatmeal to taste like roasted meat, it struggles to emulate complex gourmet flavors.
