This powered, magical armor was originally constructed in the forges of Abaddon. While primarily battery-powered, it also converts soul energy into auxiliary power. Whenever a significant enemy dies within 30 feet of an operating oblivion chassis, the armor gains a number of soul charges equal to the dead creature’s CR. As a standard action, you can spend 10 soul charges to cast the spell supercharge weapon on the armor’s unarmed strikes or a weapon in one of the armor’s weapon slots.
