#### GREGARIOUS (EX)

When a garil successfully use Diplomacy to win over an individual, that creature takes a –2 penalty on attempts to resist any of the garil’s Charisma\-based skills for the next 24 hours.

#### STUBBORN (EX)

As a swift action a garil gains a +2 racial bonus on Will saving throws to resist spells and spell-like abilities of the enchantment (charm) and enchantment (compulsion) subschools. Spending 1 Resolve point increases this to a +4 bonus for one round. In addition, if a member of this race fails such a save, it receives another save 1 round later to prematurely end the effect (assuming the spell or spell-like ability has a duration greater than 1 round). This second save is made at the same DC as the first. If the member of the race has a similar ability from another source, it can only use one of these abilities per round but can try the other on the second round if the first reroll ability fails.

ECOLOGY

**Environment** Universities, ancient ruins  
**Organization** solitary, research team (3–6)

A garil archaeologist can tell PCs secrets of ruins and relics of a specific ancient culture, granting a +2 bonus on Culture checks to identify items relating to that culture, Perception or Engineering checks when dealing with traps or secret doors in a ruin from that culture.
