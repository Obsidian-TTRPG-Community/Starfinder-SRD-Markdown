# Hollowed Drums

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 73_  

**System**:: Ears  
Hollowed drums are inserted into your ears and replace the standard eardrums of your species. This necrograft can be activated or deactivated as a swift action. When activated, it deadens sounds you hear, reducing their volume and emotional impact to grant you sonic resistance, a –2 penalty to sound-based Perception checks, and a bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects with an auditory component (such as suggestion) that vary based on the model.  
Mk 1 hollowed drums grant a +1 enhancement save bonus and sonic resistance 2. Mk 2 hollowed drums grant a +1 enhancement save bonus and sonic resistance 5. Mk 3 hollowed drums grant a +2 enhancement save bonus and sonic resistance 8. Mk 4 hollowed drums grant a +3 enhancement save bonus and sonic resistance 15. Mk 5 hollowed drums grant a +3 enhancement save bonus, sonic resistance 20, and grant no penalty to Perception checks while active.
