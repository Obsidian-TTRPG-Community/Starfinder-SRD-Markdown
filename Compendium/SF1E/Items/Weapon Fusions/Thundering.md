Effect: The _thundering_ fusion imbues a weapon with heightened frequency vibrations. Half the weapon’s damage type is replaced with sonic damage. You can activate or deactivate the _thundering_ fusion as a swift action. If the weapon already deals two types of damage, replace one of them with sonic (you decide which damage type to replace each time you activate the _thundering_ fusion). You can add this fusion only to a weapon that does not already deal sonic damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally target KAC to target EAC.
