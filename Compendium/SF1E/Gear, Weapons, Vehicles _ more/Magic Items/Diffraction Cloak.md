A _diffraction cloak_ bends light around it, causing the garment to subtly shimmer and hinting at its ability to warp nearby energy. While you wear this cloak, it protects you from cold, electricity, fire, and force damage. If an attack dealing such damage targets your EAC and hits, as a reaction you can force the attacker to be reroll the d20 and use the lower result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect that deals such damage, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and use the higher result. If you use a given _diffraction cloak_, you can’t benefit from a different one for 24 hours.  
  
The cloak allows a number of rerolls per day based on its type.
