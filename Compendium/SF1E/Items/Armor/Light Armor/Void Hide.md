# Void Hide

Made from void troll skin, _void hide armor_ quivers of its own volition, as if the manufacturing process could not subdue the troll’s life force. You can trigger _void hide_ to react to an attack as though you had the _reflecting armor_ spell cast on you. Once you have used a specific suit of _void hide_ in this way, you can use a different suit only after 24 hours have passed. A _magic resistor_ upgrade installed in void hide takes up one upgrade slot fewer than normal (minimum 0), as does a _spell reflector_ upgrade.
