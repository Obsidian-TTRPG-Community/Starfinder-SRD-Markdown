\- Bone Trooper (Other) Graft Template
Using magic rituals, technomantic experiments, or both, powerful spellcasters can animate the bones of the dead. Although many of these undead are mindless and easily controlled, others retain their intellects, memories, and personalities, and thus they are able to continue a semblance of their former lives. Called skeletal champions in previous ages, these undead are now more commonly known as bone troopers because of their frequent association with the Corpse Fleet, a renegade starship navy of undead.
A member of almost any sapient species that has a skeleton can become a bone trooper. Bone troopers keep all of the abilities, class features, and skills they had when they were living, and they can benefit from class grafts. When the dead planet Eox suffered the cataclysm that nearly destroyed the world, its inhabitants looked to necromancy for their salvation. The most powerful elebrians became bone sages, but a significant proportion of Eox’s populace that managed to survive did so as bone troopers. As a result, most bone troopers in the Pact Worlds are elebrians from Eox, recognizable by the elongated elebrian cranium.
The Corpse Fleet employs countless elebrian bone troopers, which far outnumber other undead in the exiled navy’s ranks. Most of these troopers are soldiers, although many specialize as operatives, technomancers, or mindbreaker mystics.
A bone trooper looks like a fleshless skeleton with a cold, cunning light burning in its eye sockets. Bone troopers wear normal clothing or armor and wield contemporary weapons.
