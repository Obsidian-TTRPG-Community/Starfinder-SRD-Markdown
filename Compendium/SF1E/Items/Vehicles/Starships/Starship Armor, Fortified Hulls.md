# Starship Armor, Fortified Hulls

**Source**:: _Starship Operations Manual pg. 21_  
By reinforcing critical starship systems with extra-thick armor, a starship’s designer can limit catastrophic failures caused by incoming attacks. A starship can incorporate one fortified hull upgrade, which increases the vessel’s Critical Threshold (CT) value by an amount based on the fortified hull’s material and the starship’s size category (for the purpose of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, etc.). A fortified hull is a passive system that requires no PCU to function.

|Material|Bonus to CT|Cost (in BP)|
|---|---|---|
|Steel composite|1 x size category|2 x size category|
|Adamantine alloy|2 x size category|4 x size category|
|Nanocarbon plate|3 x size category|6 x size category|
|Polycarbon plate|4 x size category|9 x size category|
|Pure adamantine|5 x size category|12 x size category|
