## DESCRIPTION

You place a unique magical mark, which is about 1 square inch in size, on a creature or object. The mark is invisible, but _detect magic_ and similar effects can reveal its presence. Unattended objects are always affected by this spell. If you attempt to affect a creature or an object in a creature's possession, the creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate the effect.

Once the _tracking mark_ is in place, you can follow the tracking mark by succeeding at a DC 20 Mysticism check. You're able to detect the tracking mark up to 1,000 feet away, and you must be on the same plane as the tracking mark to follow it.
