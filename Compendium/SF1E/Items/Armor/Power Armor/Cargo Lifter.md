A cargo lifter consists of a simple metal frame atop slow-moving legs or treads. Rather than having articulated hands, its arms end in specialized gripping tools meant to lift bulky containers. A cargo lifter can’t use weapons and takes a –4 penalty to all attack rolls. It can carry 10 bulk more than normal for its Strength score without becoming encumbered or overburdened.
