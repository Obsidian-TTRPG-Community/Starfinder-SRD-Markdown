# LITHIC GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 145_  
**Item Level** 8; **Price** 8,500; **System** Heart and Lungs  
As silicon-based creatures, quorlus’ internal anatomy differs greatly from that of most carbon-based life-forms. This augmentation reinforces parts of your heart and lungs (or similar vital organs) with silicon plates and nets, making you immune to disease and poison. However, you can never benefit from drugs, medicinals, or similar nonmagical substances. You also gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against bleed effects. You don’t need to breathe and you don’t suffer the normal effects of being in a vacuum.
