# Vulnerability (EX or SU)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 157_, _Alien Archive pg. 158_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 154_, _Alien Archive 3 pg. 155_  
The creature takes half again as much damage (+50%) when it takes damage of a specific type. Creatures with a vulnerability to an effect that doesn’t deal damage instead take a –4 penalty to saves against spells and effects that cause or use the listed vulnerability (such as enchantments). Some creatures might suffer additional effects, as noted in their stat blocks.

_Format_: **Weaknesses** vulnerable to fire.
