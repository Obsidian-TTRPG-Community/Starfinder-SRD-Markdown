## Description

You manipulate the mystical energy around a creatureâ€™s throat into a viselike grip, potentially choking the life out of your victim.

Each round you concentrate on this spell, it deals 3d8 bludgeoning damage and immobilizes the target. A creature immobilized in this way cannot move and must hold its breath (see page 404). The creature can still attack with any of its weapons (except any bite attacks), cast spells, and so on. Each round the spell affects the target, the target can attempt a Fortitude saving throw to halve the damage and avoid being immobilized.
