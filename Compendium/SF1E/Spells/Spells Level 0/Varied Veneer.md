## Description

You make the object you touch appear to be broken or otherwise worthless, or you make a broken object appear to be functional. A creature that handles the object can attempt a Will saving throw to recognize the illusion. The object functions as its actual condition indicatesâ€”this spell ends if someone attempts to use the object for its intended function.
