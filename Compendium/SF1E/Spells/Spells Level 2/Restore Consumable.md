## Description

As a reaction after an ally uses a consumable item (such as a grenade or serum, but not ammunition), you can rewind time to the moment before the item's use, creating a new copy of the item in its position before use. You immediately lose a combination of credits, UPBs, or both equal to the price of the item. You can't cast this spell if you don't have sufficient credits or UPBs to pay for the item.
