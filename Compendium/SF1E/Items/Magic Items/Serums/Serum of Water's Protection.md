A serum of water’s protection looks like a standard bottle of drinking water, but consuming it covers you with a thin layer of magically animated water. This has two effects, both of which last 1 hour. First, you gain resistance against acid and fire damage a mk 1 serum of water’s protection grants acid and fire resistance 5, a mk 2 serum grants acid and fire resistance 10, and a mk 3 serum grants acid and fire resistance 15. Second, you become vulnerable to cold damage, taking 50% more damage from cold effects.
