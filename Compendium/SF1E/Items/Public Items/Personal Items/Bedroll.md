### Description

A bedroll is pad of memory foam 2 to 3 inches thick that provides padding while you sleep, conforming to the shape of your body. It can be compressed and rolled up with attached straps for storage or transport. Most people use a blanket or sleeping bag in conjunction with a bedroll.
