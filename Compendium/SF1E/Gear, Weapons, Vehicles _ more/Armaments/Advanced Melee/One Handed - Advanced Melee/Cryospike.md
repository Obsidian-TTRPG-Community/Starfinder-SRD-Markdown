Cryospikes began as fire-extinguishing equipment, but they have since been weaponized and now serve a variety of roles. The weapon discharges a spike of hyper-cooled fluid that can be configured to put out a small fire or deal a burst of cold damage to its target. Most cryospike users integrate the apparatus’s maze of polymer tubing and coolant reservoirs into their armor to keep it always close at hand. The personal cryospike is based on a model originally designed for use in powered armor prototypes (as such early designs are prone to fires caused by engineering faults). Residential cryospikes are typically employed by firefighting crews, while industrial cryospikes is most often kept on hand in massive starship-engineering bays.

# CRYO WEAPONS

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
