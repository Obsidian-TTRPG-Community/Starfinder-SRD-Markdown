This handheld melee weapon appears to be nothing more than a handle with a slot in one end. Once a vial of an injectable substance is inserted into this slot, the ice needle forms a slender spike of ice around that liquid core, allowing you to inject the substance into a foe with a virtually untraceable weapon. Undercover and furtive ice needles are often used primarily for their injecting capabilities, while artifice, espionage, and subterfuge ice needles deal significant damage along with the injection.

# CRYO WEAPONS

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
