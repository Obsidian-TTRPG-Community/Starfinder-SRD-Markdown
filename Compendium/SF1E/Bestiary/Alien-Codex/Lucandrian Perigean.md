## Perigean Lucandrian Cr 9

Lucandrians were once humanoidshaped beings of light who took solid form over the ages. They can vary widely in appearance, but they are typically 6 feet tall and around 165 pounds. Most have pale skin tinted in a pastel color, such as blue or purple, but some are stone gray or bone white.
These fey derive their powers from moons. Most have abilities related to reffected light, and as lucandrians mature, they can develop other lunar magic. Perigean lucandrians, for instance, cultivate gravitational powers.
Because of their nature, lucandrians are drawn to worlds that have numerous moons, such as Liavara and Bretheda. However, their curiosity, manifested as scholarly interest, makes them natural explorers. Young lucandrians search the galaxy for trinkets and amusements, as well as lunar influences, to develop new powers. Mature lucandrians are more introspective, prone to spending long periods in contemplation or creating unique objects. Lucandrians enjoy charting the nighttime sky, nurturing crystal gardens, and decorating their dwellings.
Though lucandrians are an overall-peaceful species, they can be territorial, which has led to clashes with those interested in commercializing the moons on which these fey dwell. Lucandrians sometimes set their sights on inscrutable personal aims as they explore or develop their supernatural capabilities, bringing them into conflict with those around them. Lucandrians also fight to protect their secrets. Offering help, honest respect, or a gift can head off such clashes. Lucandrians treasure and defend young creatures of any species, perhaps because lucandrian offspring are difficult to create. Prospective parents combine tiny bits of soul with dust from a moon in a complex magical process, placing the mixture into an ovoid crystalline vessel. This “egg” gestates for 27 days. If the ritual is successful, a new lucandrian coalesces inside the vessel at that time, emerging as a small, yet fully formed lucandrian another 27 days later.
