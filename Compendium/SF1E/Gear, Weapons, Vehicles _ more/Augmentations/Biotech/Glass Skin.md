# GLASS SKIN
**Source** _Alien Archive 2 pg. 65_  
**Item Level** 4; **Price** 2,000; **System** Skin  
This biotech modification covers your skin with tiny, clear scales that shimmer with rainbows, as if you were constantly encased in a thin layer of ice or glass. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to become temporarily invisible (as the _invisibility_ spell) for up to 1 minute.
