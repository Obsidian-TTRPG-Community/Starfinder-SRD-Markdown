# Plenipotentiary

Diplomats are ambassadors for their people, working to establish better relationships with those from other cultures, find ways for groups to collaborate, and realize peaceful solutions when violence seems imminent. Given the stakes for fumbling a negotiation, diplomats are highly trained professionals who are equally capable of charming others and evading political traps.  
However, diplomats aren’t necessarily the PCs’ allies. An evil empire might employ diplomats who suppress internal dissent and international complaints through clever misdirection. Diplomats might introduce well-intentioned political entanglements in defense of their own objectives, even if these limit the PCs’ abilities to thwart some greater evil. A diplomat is often a non-combat threat, challenging PCs to employ logic, guile, and charm to discourage, discredit, or sway their rival.

### Special Abilities

**Instinctive Command (Ex)** As a move action, a plenipotentiary can issue an order with hypnotizing confidence to a creature within 60 feet. This functions as command (Will DC 20 negates). After using this ability, the plenipotentiary can’t do so again for 1d6 rounds, though at any time they can reduce the number of rounds by 3 for every Resolve Point they spend.

## Description

A plenipotentiary is an elite diplomat vested with the full power of their government to act and craft novel treaties without prior clearance. They command potent tools: state secrets, communication magic, and often an entourage of capable assistants. They rarely achieve this role without showing exemplary wisdom and self-control; however, power corrupts some plenipotentiaries, turning them into terrifying political juggernauts who can spread chaos unless their patrons intervene quickly.
