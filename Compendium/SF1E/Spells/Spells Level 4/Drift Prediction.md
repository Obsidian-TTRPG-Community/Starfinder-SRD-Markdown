## Description

You glimpse a narrow range of possibilities related to a starship’s next Drift journey initiated within the next 24 hours. When you cast this spell, choose one of the following distances: travel in-system, travel to Absalom station, travel to Near Space, or travel to the Vast. Make a DC 20 caster level check (1d20 + your caster level). If you succeed, make any necessary random rolls related to the Drift journey you predicted, such as the duration and the chance of a random encounter in the Drift. If the starship initiates Drift travel of the distance you predicted before the spell’s duration expires, apply those rolls to the journey. This spell doesn’t allow you to anticipate any extra time the starship might spend on its journey, such as if it stops to explore or engage in starship combat, and you can’t anticipate whether the ship will complete its journey or stop for some reason, such as to exit the Drift early, or because it was destroyed.  
Casting this spell requires access to a computer or similar device, which displays the information gained. Additionally, casting this spell places considerable strain on you, requiring you to spend 1 Resolve Point.
