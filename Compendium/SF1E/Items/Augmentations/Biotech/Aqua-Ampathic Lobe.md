# Aqua-ampathic Lobe

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 58_  
**Item Level** 4;
**Price**::  2,000; **System** Brain  
Your brain has been modified with an additional lobe that grants you a limited form of telepathic communication with aquatic creatures. You can communicate with animals, magical beasts, plants, and vermin that don’t have a language and are native to aquatic biomes; this includes such creatures with the aquatic subtype and might also include other creatures at the GM’s discretion. This ability doesn’t make these creatures friendly. The range of this ability is 30 feet or the range of your telepathy or limited telepathy, whichever is larger. You can use language-dependent effects on these creatures, attempt Intimidate checks to bully them, and attempt Diplomacy checks to change their attitude.
