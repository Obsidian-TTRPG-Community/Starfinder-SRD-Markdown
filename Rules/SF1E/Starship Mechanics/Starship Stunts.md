# STARSHIP STUNTS

Instead of ordinary movement, pilots can attempt stunts with their starships (see Stunt on page 324), pushing them beyond their design specifications to enact daring moves. Several stunts affect your starship’s Armor Class (AC) and Target Lock (TL).

## BACK OFF

The starship moves up to half its speed in the direction of the aft edge without changing facing. It can’t take any turns during this movement. To perform this stunt, you must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your starship’s tier). On a failed check, your starship moves backward only 1 hex. If you fail this check by 5 or more, your starship does not move at all and takes a –4 penalty to its AC and TL until the start of the next round.

## BARREL ROLL

The starship moves up to half its speed and flips along its central axis. For the next gunnery phase, the starship’s port shields and weapons function as if they were in the starboard firing arc and vice versa. The starship reverts to normal at the beginning of the next round. To perform this stunt, your starship must be Large or smaller and you must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your starship’s tier). On a failed check, the starship moves half its speed but doesn’t roll. If you fail by 5 or more, your starship moves half its speed, doesn’t roll, and takes a –4 penalty to its AC and TL until the start of the next round.

## EVADE

The ship moves up to its speed and can turn as normal, but it gains a +2 circumstance bonus to its AC and TL until the start of the next round. To perform this stunt, you must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your starship’s tier). If you fail, the starship moves as normal. If you fail the check by 5 or more, the starship moves as normal, but it also takes a –2 penalty to its AC and TL until the start of the next round.

## FLIP AND BURN

The ship moves forward up to half its speed (without turning) and rotates 180 degrees to face the aft edge at the end of the movement. To perform this stunt, you must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × your ship’s tier). If you fail this check, your starship moves forward half its speed but doesn’t rotate.

## FLYBY

The ship moves as normal, but it can move through 1 hex occupied by an enemy starship without provoking a free attack (as described in Moving through Other Starships). During the following gunnery phase, you can select one arc of your starship’s weapons to fire at the enemy vessel as if the vessel were in close range (treat the range as 1 hex), against any quadrant of the enemy starship. To perform this stunt, you must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the tier of the enemy starship). If you fail this check, your starship still moves as described above, but you follow the normal rules for attacking (based on your starship’s final position and distance), and the movement provokes a free attack from that starship as normal.

## SLIDE

The starship moves up to its speed in the direction of either the forward-port or forward-starboard edge without changing its facing. To perform this stunt, you must succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × your ship’s tier). If you fail this check, the ship moves forward up to half its speed and can’t make any turns.

## TURN IN PLACE

The ship does not move but instead can turn to face any direction. If the ship has a maneuverability of clumsy, it takes a –4 penalty to its AC and TL until the start of the next round. If it has a maneuverability of poor, it instead takes a –2 penalty to its AC and TL until the start of the next round. Ships with a maneuverability of average or better do not take a penalty. This stunt doesn’t require a skill check.  

## RAMMING SPEED (STUNT)

The starship increases its distance between turns by 2 (to a maximum of 4) and moves up to its speed, but it can move through 1 hex occupied by an enemy starship that has already moved during this helm phase. To perform this stunt, you must first succeed at a Piloting check (DC = 15 + 1/1-2 × your starship’s tier). If you succeed, you then attempt a gunnery check against the enemy starship’s AC upon entering that starship’s hex.

If the gunnery check succeeds, your starship collides with the enemy starship, dealing collision damage to each based on your starship’s speed and the sizes of the two starships. The base collision damage equals 1d4 × half your starship’s speed, plus an additional 1d4 damage × a value based on your starship’s size (for the purpose of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, etc.). The enemy starship takes the full damage to the struck quadrant, and your starship takes half this damage to its forward quadrant, after which your movement ends. If your starship has a ramming weapon, add the ramming weapon’s damage to the damage to the enemy starship. If your starship is one size category smaller than the enemy ship or larger, you push the ship 1 hex in the direction your ship is facing. If this would push the ship into an occupied hex, the ship does not move but instead takes additional damage equal to your starship’s tier. If your starship is more than one size category smaller than the enemy starship, your starship returns to the hex from which it entered the enemy ship’s hex, facing that starship.

If the initial Piloting check fails, your starship still moves as described and doesn’t attempt the gunnery check, but the movement provokes a free attack from that starship as normal. If the Piloting check is successful yet the gunnery check fails, your starship still moves as described, but the movement doesn’t provoke a free attack from that starship.
