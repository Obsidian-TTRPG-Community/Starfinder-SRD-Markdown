These narrow clubs are often constructed of numerous intertwined bones—as one might expect from a weapon designed by Eoxians—infused with a silvery absolute-zero alloy that instantly draws the heat out of living creatures on contact. Chill bone scepters and void bone scepters have fine threads of the rare alloy, while rigor bone scepters and cadaver bone scepters shimmer with it.

# Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
