# Pilot Assist

Artificial intelligence in the vehicle’s onboard computer automatically course-corrects while this vehicle is driven, compensating for driver error, inattentiveness, slow response time, and external factors such as uneven terrain, potholes, ocean currents, and gusts of wind. This increases the vehicle’s Piloting modifier by an amount based on the modification’s model.
