# Dimensional Crash

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 139_  
**Classes**:: Technomancer 3, Witchwarper 3  
**School**:: conjuration (teleportation)  
**Casting-Time**:: 1 standard action  
**Range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Targets**:: you and one creature within range  
**Duration**:: instantaneous  
**Saving-Throw**:: Reflex half
**Spell Resistance**:: No

## Description

You instantly transfer yourself from your current location to a spot within range that’s occupied by another creature, otherwise functioning as per dimension door. You take 1d6 bludgeoning damage, and the other creature takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage (Reflex half). Attempt a bull rush combat maneuver against the other creature, using your caster level + your key ability score modifier + 2 as your attack bonus. Compare the result to the target’s KAC + 8, as normal. For every 5 feet the creature travels this way, it takes an additional 1d6 bludgeoning damage. If your bull rush combat maneuver fails, you immediately move to the nearest available space; this movement doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity.
