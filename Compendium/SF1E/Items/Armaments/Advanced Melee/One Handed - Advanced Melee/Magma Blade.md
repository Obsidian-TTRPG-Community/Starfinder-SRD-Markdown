Though this sturdy sword appears to be made of stone when inactive, once powered the blade cracks and melts into a glowing bar of magma held in place by magnetic fields. The incredible heat inflicts grievous injuries on targets. Rhyolite magma blades are the most affordable model, andesite and basalt magma blades have increased intensity, and the formidable plagioclase magma blade is the most dangerous.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
