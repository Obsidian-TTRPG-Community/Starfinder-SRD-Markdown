# Underworld Mastermind

Those who amass extraordinary wealth, power, and influence often use them to perpetuate their advantages, typically through violent or coercive means. Tyrants might maintain their rule through subterfuge and surveillance or through age-old and expedient threats and brute force. What unifies tyrants across philosophical and ideological divides is the willingness and ruthlessness to pursue extraordinarily ends to justify their means, often at a terrible cost to those who dare oppose them.

## Description

The deadliest tyrants rule from the shadows. By blending in among minions, bystanders, and rivals alike, an underworld mastermind can steal secrets, manipulate social phenomena, and rule multiple organizations under many guises. Such a power broker often needs pawns—willing or unwitting—and they could act as a patron who maneuvers young adventurers to eventually gain an advantage.
