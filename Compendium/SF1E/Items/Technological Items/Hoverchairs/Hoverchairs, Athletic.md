### Description

The athletic hoverchair model’s stronger propulsion system and sleeker design are tailored for action-packed lifestyles. The hoverchair can hover up to 3 feet above the ground, and by temporarily increasing its usage to 1/minute, the hoverchair can hover over dense fluids (like deep water) that couldn’t otherwise support it. This model includes three easily accessible compartments that can each store up to 1 bulk worth of items, and it includes three utility gear slots. In addition, the hoverchair includes one armor upgrade slot that can be used only to install weapons with the integrated weapon special property, which the user can operate.
