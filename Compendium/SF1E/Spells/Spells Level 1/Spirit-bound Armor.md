## DESCRIPTION

You divert a benevolent spirit from the River of Souls to temporarily inhabit a suit of armor. The spirit steadies the nerves and balance of the creature wearing the armor. If the target becomes flat-footed during the duration, it ignores the penalty to AC that condition imposes. Similarly, the off-kilter condition has no effect on the target while this spell is in effect.
