### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Gentle Thrum (Su)** The klikharp’s gentle thrum is especially soothing for shirrens and other creatures with blindsense (vibration), including themselves. Affected creatures gain a +2 morale bonus to saves against emotion and pain effects.  
**Mutations (Ex)** The klikharp has a mutable genetic code resulting from of once being a part of the Swarm. Each klikharp starts with two mutations from the list below; they can add an additional mutation at 7th level and another at 13th. At each level they can slip into their chrysalis for a week and switch out the mutations they previously selected. The exception to this is the growth option, which is permanent.  
_Bioluminescent:_ As a move action, the klikharp can increase the light level two steps (to a maximum of normal light) in a 10-foot radius centered on itself for 1 minute.  
_Burrowing:_ The klikharp has a burrow speed of 30 feet.  
_Discordant:_ The klikharp can make a shriek ranged attack that deals sonic damage, targets EAC, and has a range increment of 30 feet.  
_Growth:_ The klikharp grows one size category. It can choose this option twice to become Huge. Growth mutations can’t be undone.  
_Maestro:_ As a move action, the klikharp can imitate any instrument or sound (but not speech), giving a creature a +4 circumstance bonus to Profession (musician) checks. The target must have the klikharp as its bonded creature companion.  
_Sealed Carapace:_ The klikharp gains the void adaptation universal creature rule (page 157).  
_Springy:_ The klikharp can take 20 on Athletics checks to jump and the DC is not doubled for lacking a running start.  
_Winged:_ The Klikharp has a flight speed of 30 feet (Ex., average). The klikharp must be 7th level or higher to select this mutation.
