# MECH POWER CORES
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 102_  
A mech’s power core generates all the energy necessary to pilot the mech and operate its major functions. Each power core also generates some excess energy, measured as Power Points (PP; see page 113), which an operator can expend to enhance the mech’s performance and execute extraordinary maneuvers. Each power core has: a rate, representing the number of PP it generates at the end of its turn; an initial value, representing the number of PP a mech has when it begins an encounter; and a maximum (shown in parentheses), representing the maximum PP the core can store during combat. A mech can use only a single power core.  
Optionally, a power core can acquire one power core template that modifies some of its statistics or provides additional ways to generate or use Power Points.

Cost: A mk 0 power core (dynamo or eternal) is free. Every other power core costs a number of MP equal to the power core’s mk rating multiplied by the mech’s tier. For example, a mk 3 eternal core for a tier 9 mech costs 27 MP.

## AEON CORE TEMPLATE

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 102_  
Developed by the Azlanti Star Empire, this power core template converts magical energy into mechanical force.  
**Prerequisite** Can be applied only to an eternal core.  
**Rate** +0; **Initial** -1; **Maximum** -1  
**Special** Once per round, an operator can expend an unused spell slot to grant the mech a number of Power Points equal to half the spell slot’s level, rounded down.  
**Cost** 0 x tier

## BATTLE CORE TEMPLATE

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 102_  
This template, blessed by priests of Damoritosh, takes the Conqueror’s divine favor and converts it into mechanical adrenaline.  
**Prerequisite** Can be applied only to a core with a rate greater than 1.  
**Rate** -1; **Initial** +0; **Maximum** +1  
**Special** Can be applied only to a core with a rate greater than 1.  
**Cost** 0.5 x tier

## CORPSEGNAWER CORE TEMPLATE

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 102_  
Eoxian engineers pioneered this core template, granting the mech an insatiable hunger for souls.  
**Rate** +0; **Initial** +0; **Maximum** +0  
**Special** As a standard action, the mech can draw the residual life energy out of a creature within its reach that died within the past minute. The power core’s rate increases by 1, which lasts 1 round for every 4 levels or CR the dead creature possessed. The mech can’t draw energy from the same creature more than once, and the creature’s level or CR must be at least half the mech’s tier (minimum 1). A mech can’t increase its rate by more than 1 in this way.  
**Cost** 0.5 x tier

## SCRAPPER CORE TEMPLATE

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 102_  
This power core template is programmed to grant exceptional power when its mech is at greatest risk.  
**Rate** +0; **Initial** +0; **Maximum** +0  
**Special** Whenever the mech gains a system failure condition, the mech gains 1d4 Power Points. The mech can exceed its PP maximum in this way, but any excess PP not expended by the end of its next turn are lost.  
**Cost** 1 x tier
