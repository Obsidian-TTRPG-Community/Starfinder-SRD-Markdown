# Notorious Bounty Hunter

Anyone who seeks and catches those who don’t want to be caught may be called a bounty hunter, though in practice, the term comprises an array of professionals. Most bounty hunters have legal sanction, such as a license to hunt fugitives, but many also work in a gray area between legal authority and vigilantism. Bounty hunters take jobs from legitimate authorities, but what legitimate means varies by location. Little stops a bounty hunter from acting as an agent of a private party, and many are enforcers for the unscrupulous. Some clever bounty hunters double as private investigators, tracking down missing people or runaways.

### Special Abilities

**Intimidating (Ex)** A notorious bounty hunter can demoralize using Intimidate as a move action. As a full action, the bounty hunter can demoralize up to 10 creatures within 60 feet; the Intimidate DC equals the highest DC to demoralize among the targets. If the check succeeds, the shaken condition lasts only 1 round for all affected targets.  
**Mark (Ex)** A notorious bounty hunter can choose one sapient creature as a mark, provided the notorious bounty hunter can identify that creature by a specific identity and has studied the mark for 1 hour using available information, or directly observed the mark for 1 minute outside of combat or as a full action in combat. The notorious bounty hunter gains an insight bonus on skill checks made to investigate, track, or gather information on the mark, as well as on Sense Motive checks against the mark. This bonus equals 1 + the notorious bounty hunter’s CR divided by 6 (+3 total at CR 14). Also, the notorious bounty hunter can use Sense Motive instead of Perception to use the pierce disguise or search tasks of the Perception skill against the mark.

## Description

A notorious bounty hunter has not only a reputation for success, but also one of mercilessness and resilience. Such bounty hunters take on the toughest targets, preferring dead-or-alive contracts that can increase their renown. These bounty hunters prefer intimidation, using crowd control tactics and few nonlethal options. Even when apparently killed, these professionals rarely stay dead, ensuring they’re as immortal as their legends are.
