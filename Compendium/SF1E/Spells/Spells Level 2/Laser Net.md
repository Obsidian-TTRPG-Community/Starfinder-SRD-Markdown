## Description

This spell creates a net of dangerous lasers between two solid points. The net can appear only if there are appropriate anchoring surfaces at both ends of the beams, such as two walls, a wall and a ceiling, or the like. Otherwise, the spell fails.  
Creatures that move through the laser net must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or take 1d6+1 fire damage per 5 feet of laser net they move through. Creatures that move no more than 5 feet in the laser net receive a +2 circumstance bonus to this saving throw, but creatures that move through more than 15 feet of the laser net in a single turn take a â€“2 penalty to the saving throw.
