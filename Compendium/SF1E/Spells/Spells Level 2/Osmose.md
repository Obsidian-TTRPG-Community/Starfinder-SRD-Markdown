## DESCRIPTION

Initially developed by impatient bantrid students, this spell has grown in popularity among those that want to consume a lot of information quickly. You touch one object and concentrate on a single data set contained within the object, such as a story, email, file, video, or website. You understand the gist of the data set and can quickly locate the most relevant pages or sections to your search. If the data set is written in a language you don't know, or you attempt to gain information from a computer you don't have access to, this spell automatically fails.
