### Description

This serum contains distilled energies from the Plane of Fire. It glows a dim red and emits a constant heat, regardless of ambient temperature. When you drink this serum, your body becomes covered in illusory flames. For 1 minute, any creature that hits you with a melee attack must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or take 5 fire damage. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on this saving throw, it also gains the burning condition for 5 damage.
