# LIMITED PLANT BENEFITS (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 3 pg. 152_  
Despite being a plant creature, the creature doesnâ€™t gain the standard immunities associated with creatures of the plant type. Instead, a creature with this ability gains a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning effects, unless the effect specifies that it is effective against plants.

_Format_: **Defensive Abilities** limited plant benefits.
