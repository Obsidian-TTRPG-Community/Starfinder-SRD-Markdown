## Magic Sensors

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 30_

**Cost (in BP)**:: Sensors cost  
Magic sensors, whether enchanted crystals or rune-encrusted lenses, can be purchased alongside normal sensors at an additional cost equal to the normal sensorsâ€™ cost. Outside starship combat, a crew member can use magic sensors to detect magic (as the spell) to a range of 1 mile from the ship.
