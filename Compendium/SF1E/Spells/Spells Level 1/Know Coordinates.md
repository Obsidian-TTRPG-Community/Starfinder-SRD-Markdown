## DESCRIPTION

You learn the general location of one creature on the same planetary body as you, up to the size of a large planet, such as a gas giant. You must be able to identify the creature clearly from personal knowledge of who they are. If you and the creature you identify are not on the same planet-sized body, the spell fails. You can input the coordinates into any computer attached to an infosphere on the same planet to find general directions. If you use the Piloting skillâ€™s navigation task to reach the coordinates, these directions make your familiarity seldom visited (DC 15) even if the area would normally be unfamiliar.
