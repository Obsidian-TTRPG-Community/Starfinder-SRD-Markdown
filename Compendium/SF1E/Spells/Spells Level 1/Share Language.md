## Description

For 24 hours, the target can read, understand, and communicate to the best of its ability in up to three languages that you already know. This doesn’t change the physical nature of the creature (if it lacks a means of speech, it still can’t talk) or its attitude toward you. It does, however, allow intelligent creatures that normally have no language to understand and (if physically capable) communicate in the languages granted by this spell.
