## DESCRIPTION

You unknit the fabric of time and remake it to suit your will. A _rewrite time_ spell can produce one of the following effects.

-   Duplicate any precog spell of 6th level or lower.
-   Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.
-   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_.
-   Produce an effect of a power level in line with the above.

At the GM's discretion, _rewrite time_ can produce greater effects, but can be dangerous or might have only a partial effect.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 7th-level spell. For other effects based on spell level, _rewrite time_ is a 9th- level spell.
