# TETRAD CARAVEL
The Tetrad manufactures its own line of starships using unique hybrid technology, including proprietary planar aperture drives that enable the witchwyrds to travel between planes as well as into the Drift. Under no circumstances are these engines sold to non-witchwyrds. In the Pact Worlds, one of the most commonly encountered style of witchwyrd starships is the Tetrad Caravel, named after an ancient oceangoing vessel.
