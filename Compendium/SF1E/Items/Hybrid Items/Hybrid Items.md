# Hybrid Items

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 226_
Hybrid equipment makes use of both technology and magic though not necessarily in equal measure, both forces are crucial to the item’s function. Effects that modify or otherwise apply to magic or [[Technological Items]] also work when applied to hybrid items.

## Charges

In some cases, hybrid items may require charges. However, such charged hybrid items typically function in a different way from charged [[Technological Items]], whose batteries must be recharged or replaced. A hybrid item’s charges are inherent to the construction of the item and can’t be replenished with generators or batteries. Charges for a hybrid item either refresh each day or never refresh, depending on the item.

## Wearing Hybrid Items

Hybrid items you wear on your body count as [[Magic Items]]  when you are determining how many you can use at once (see page 222). You can wear only up to two total hybrid or [[Magic Items]]  at a time for them to both function normally. Like for [[Magic Items]] , you cannot wear more than one of the same type of hybrid item except for rings. For instance, you could not wear both a _[[Mindlink Circlet]]_ and a _[[Tiara of Translocation]]_. You cannot wear a magic item and hybrid item of the same type at the same time.
