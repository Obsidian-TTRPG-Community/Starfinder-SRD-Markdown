## Description

Beckoning to all realities at once, you pull in new possibilities and alter your world to suit you. A _warp reality_ spell can produce one of the following effects.

-   Duplicate any witchwarper spell of 6th level or lower.
-   Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.
-   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_.
-   Produce an effect of a power level in line with the above.

At the GM’s discretion, _warp reality_ can produce greater effects but can be dangerous or might have only a partial effect.  
A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are as for a 7th-level spell. For other effects based on spell level, _warp reality_ is a 9th-level spell.
