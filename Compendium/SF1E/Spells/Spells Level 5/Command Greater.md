# Command, Greater

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 343_  
**Classes**:: Mystic 5  
**School**:: enchantment (compulsion, language-dependent, mind-affecting)  
**Targets**:: up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
**Duration**:: 1 round/level  

## Description

This spell functions like _command_, except you can affect up to one creature per level and the targets continue the specified activity beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creatureâ€™s action after the first, it can attempt another Will saving throw to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
