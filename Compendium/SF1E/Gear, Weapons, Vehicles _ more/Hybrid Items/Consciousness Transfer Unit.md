# CONSCIOUSNESS TRANSFER UNIT
**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 133_  
**Level** 14; **Price** 89,700; **Bulk** 20

### DESCRIPTION

This metal-and-glass disk is 8 feet in diameter and has a series of sensors and electrodes mounted along one edge. In a process that takes 1 minute, a creature lying on the disk can attach electrodes to their head (or equivalent region) and transfer their mind into a computer or construct adjacent to the consciousness transfer unit, functioning as transfer consciousness (CL 14th). If the creature whose consciousness is transferred is unwilling, they can negate this effect with a successful DC 22 Will save. Once a creature has been affected by the device, whether the effect succeeded or not, they’re immune to that consciousness transfer unit’s effects for 24 hours.
