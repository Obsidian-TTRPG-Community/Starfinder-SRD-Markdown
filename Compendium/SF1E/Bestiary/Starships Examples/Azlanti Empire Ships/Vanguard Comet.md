## Description

Vanguard’s luxury shuttle, the Comet is a sleek ship designed to rapidly deliver passengers and cargo and to outrun its foes. Vanguard Comet captains do everything they can to bring the ship’s speed to bear. The Comet isn’t made for a close-quarters firefight, but few other vessels can match it in a chase.  
  
A Vanguard Comet is configurable. Instead of three cargo bays, it can have other systems and expansions worth no more than 3 Build Points. It has 48 PCU to spare for those expansions. Usually, a Comet has guest quarters and escape pods for one or two important passengers.
