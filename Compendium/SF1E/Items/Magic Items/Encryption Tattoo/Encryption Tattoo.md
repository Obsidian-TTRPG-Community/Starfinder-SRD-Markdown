The secretive members of the Android Abolitionist Front identify each other with invisible magical tattoos. When you are within 60 feet of a being with another _encryption tattoo_ and activate your _encryption tattoo_ with a code word as a move action, your tattoo becomes visible for 1 minute and glows faintly. The tattoo closely resembles the glowing circuit patterns prevalent on android skin, and is therefore particularly obvious on non-androids. The _agent encryption tattoo_ is the standard type of _encryption tattoo_. Certain _encryption tattoos_, when activated with a different code word, also grant you damage reduction: _operative encryption tattoos_ provide DR 5/—, _provocateur encryption tattoos_ provide DR 10/—, and _master encryption tattoos_ provide DR 15/—. This damage reduction doesn’t stack with any damage reduction you already have. The damage reduction lasts for the 1 minute your tattoo is visible.

Although there is no limit on the number of times you can cause your _encryption tattoo_ to appear, you can activate its power to gain DR only once per day.

An _encryption tattoo_ doesn’t count as a worn magic item, and it can’t be disarmed or sundered. In addition, it can be installed in an android’s racial armor upgrade slot.
