## Description

You ward an area to alert you when creatures enter without your permission. When you cast proximity alert, select a password. Whenever a Small or larger corporeal creature of a CR lower than your caster level enters the spell's area without speaking the password, proximity alert sends you a mental alert or an audible alarm (your choice). Either option automatically awakens you, and the audible alarm allows each creature in the area to attempt a DC 15 Perception check to wake up.
