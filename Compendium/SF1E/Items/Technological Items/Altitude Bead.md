### Description

This small, metal bead syncs with a comm unit to transmit its relative location from a starting point. When dropped more than 10 feet, accelerometers inside the bead begin measuring how far the bead has fallen. Once it stops free falling, an app on the connected comm unit displays how far the bead fell and the bead’s relative position from the user, to a range of 5 miles.
