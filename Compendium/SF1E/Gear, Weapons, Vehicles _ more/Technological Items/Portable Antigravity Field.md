### DESCRIPTION

This compact cartridge contains a minuscule artificial gravity suspender. When activated as a standard action, a portable antigravity field temporarily decreases the gravitational forces in an area by one step (extreme to heavy, heavy to standard, standard to light, and light to zero gravity) in a 20-ft. radius burst. This effect lasts until the device runs out of charges or until it’s deactivated as a move action. This item has no effect in an area that already has zero gravity.
