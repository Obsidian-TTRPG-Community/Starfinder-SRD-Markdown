# Serum, X-Ray

**Source**:: Starfinder Armory pg. 116
**Level**:: 4
**Price**:: 350
**Bulk**:: —

## Description

When you drink X-ray serum, a fluid that looks like mercury and tastes like metal, your eyes turn white. For 1 minute, you can activate or suppress your X-ray vision as a move action. While your X-ray vision is active, you have sense through (vision) that can be blocked by 2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal. Your X-ray vision is black and white, and while you use it, you lose the benefit of any vision other than darkvision. In addition, while using X-ray vision, you can’t attempt sight-based Perception checks beyond 60 feet.
