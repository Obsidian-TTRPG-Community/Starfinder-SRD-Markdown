# PROTEAN RESPONSE
This series of glands supplements the adrenal system, triggering a spontaneous transformation into a supernatural (and often more ferocious) form when your body experiences extreme stress. When you acquire and install this augmentation, you choose one polymorphed form and its abilities, per the spell polymorph. The spell level of the polymorph effect equals that of the augmentation’s model number (e.g. polymorph as a 4th-level spell for a mk 4 augmentation).  
As a reaction when you take a critical hit in combat or fail a Fortitude save, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate this augmentation; alternatively, you can activate the augmentation as a full action by spending 3 Resolve Points. Your body begins transforming into your polymorphed form, as though you were the target of a polymorph spell, completing its transformation at the beginning of your next turn. You retain your polymorphed form for 1 minute or until you end the effect as a standard action, after which you become fatigued for 1 minute. This transformation is an extraordinary ability that is not subject to dispel magic or similar effects.
