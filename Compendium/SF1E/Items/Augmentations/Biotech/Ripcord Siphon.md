# Ripcord Siphon

**Source**:: _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 83_  
**Item Level** 4;
**Price**::  1,750; **System** All Hands or All Feet  
Originally designed as the last line of safety for a technician falling from an orbital installation into space, these sacs eject bursts of stored air to provide the wearer enhanced control and maneuverability in zero-gravity situations or during flight. When you are flying and use the charge action, you can use your ripcord siphon to make one turn of up to 90 degrees as part of the move, as long as you have moved at least 10 feet in the initial direction.  
When you are floating in zero gravity, you can expel the bladders to propel yourself 30 feet in any direction as a move action; this counts as creating thrust for the purposes of moving in zero gravity.  
Once you’ve used your ripcord siphon, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.
