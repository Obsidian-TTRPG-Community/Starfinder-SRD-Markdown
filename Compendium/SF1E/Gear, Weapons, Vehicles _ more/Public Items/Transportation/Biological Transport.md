Most civilized planets rely on technological transportation, but less-developed worlds often utilize living creatures for travel. Such creatures are as varied in size, shape, color, and features as the planets they inhabit. Typically, biological transport is slower and more expensive than automated travel, but in frontier regions, it may be the only option available. Biological transport can be rented on a daily basis, with prices determined by the size of the creature. The listed price does not include the cost of feeding and maintaining the creature. Generally, rented biological transport requires riders to control and direct the creatures, using the ride a creature task of the Survival skill.

Alternatively, you can simply purchase a ride on biological transport, with prices determined by the size of the creature and the distance traveled. For Large or larger creatures, the listed price typically includes a trained handler for that animal who directs it toward your destination.
