# Undead Adrenal Gland

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 97_  
**System** Endocrine  
An undead adrenal gland supplements your own adrenal gland or similar organ. It floods your body with necrotic energy that counteracts many of the failings of living flesh. Once per day, you can activate an undead adrenal gland as a move action. This grants you immunity to death effects, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, paralysis, sleep, and stunning for a number of minutes equal to the necrograft’s mark, though this doesn’t suppress any of these effects if they are currently active.
