# HEAT TRACKER GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 144_  
**Item Level** 3; **Price** 1,225; **System** All Eyes  
Phentomites have the ability to see heat signatures. You can bring down a reactive, transparent film installed as a second set of eyelids so that you can see the same signatures as a full action. You can then detect the latent heat trails left by passing creatures, allowing you to use the Perception skill to perform the follow tracks task of the Survival skill; this also functions as the tracking universal creature rule. While this ability is active, you take a –1 penalty to Reflex saving throws. You can deactivate this ability as a move action.
