# Azlanti Mechs

The Azlanti Star Empire manufactures a variety of powerful weapons to maintain total supremacy over its sector of space, and their mechs prove no exception. These paragons of weaponized technomagic typically feature sleek, humanoid shapes inspired by the conventional Aeon Guard armored silhouette. The Star Empire’s mechs are reflections of the empire’s grandeur and hubris, and Azlanti manufacturers design models with equal consideration paid to aesthetics and combat functionality.  
Two of the most common Azlanti models are the Aeon Striker and the Imperator Pinion. The Aeon Striker relies on its inherent mobility and speed—along with the twitch reflexes of its operators—to control the battlefield. Strikers are found at the flash points of battles, teleporting into the action and unleashing flurries of attacks against larger, slower enemies. After delivering these surgical attacks, the Striker blinks out of range to pursue the next target.
