You can use weapons in the shock category to perform dirty trick combat maneuvers against targets with the technological subtype and to perform sunder combat maneuvers. For ranged attacks, either maneuver can only be attempted against targets within the first range increment, and you make a ranged attack against the targetâ€™s KAC + 8 instead of a melee attack roll.
