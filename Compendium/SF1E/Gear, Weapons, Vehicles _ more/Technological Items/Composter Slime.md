# COMPOSTER SLIME

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 46_  
**Level** 5; **Price** 2000  
**Hands** —; **Bulk** 1

### DESCRIPTION

Marketed for the modern sustainable lifestyle, this dormant, biogenetically-engineered nanite organism is sold securely sealed within its own industrial grade plastic container. Once you unseal the package, the composter slime becomes active and requires at least 1 bulk of organic matter per week to survive. Once per week, you can feed the composter slime an object of no more than 1 bulk and whose price does not exceed 500 credits and, after 24 hours of digestion, the slime excretes dry waste pellets that function as UPBs with a market value equal to half that of the item consumed. These pellets are semi-stable, degrading into worthless powder after one month if not used to craft an object.  
Composter slimes are functionally sessile. Once active, a slime lives for 20 weeks before dying of old age.
