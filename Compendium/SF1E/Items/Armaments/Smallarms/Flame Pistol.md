Inventive manufacturers have developed more effective versions of the classic flame pistol, resulting in the blaze, inferno, and solar flare models. Like other flame pistols, the more advanced models fire lines of ignited petrol from their barrels, but they work at higher pressure and include nanotechnology that breaks down the petrol into more volatile compounds as the weapon is fired.

### Flame Weapons
Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
