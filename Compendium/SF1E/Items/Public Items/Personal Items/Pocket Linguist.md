### Description

This glassy disk developed by field linguists connects wirelessly to a nearby computer and scans any writing it’s passed over. The pocket linguist doesn’t actually translate text but instead analyzes characters and symbols to identify patterns and compare results to a library of writing samples, sending its realtime analytics to the linked computer or comm unit. If you use a pocket linguist while using Culture to decipher writing, you double the amount of time required but receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the Culture check.
