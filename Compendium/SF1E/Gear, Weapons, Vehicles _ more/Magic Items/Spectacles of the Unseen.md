### DESCRIPTION

Even in a cosmopolitan galaxy, there are aliens whose actions, influence, and even presence are rarely confirmed, even denied in some cases. These unassuming spectacles grant you exceptional sensitivity to conspiracies and hidden truths everywhere, giving you a +2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks to pierce disguises and a +2 circumstance bonus to Sense Motive checks. However, when you fail any Sense Motive check to detect deception or discern secret messages, you automatically misinterpret the event (typically sensing sinister or conspiratorial intent), as though you had failed the check by 5 or more.
