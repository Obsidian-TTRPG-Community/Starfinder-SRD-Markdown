## Description

Reaching to worlds beyond, you siphon your foe's life force as a shared offering to some extraplanar entity. Attempt a melee attack against the target's EAC, adding the higher of your key ability modifier or your Strength modifier to the attack roll. On a hit, the target takes 8d8 damage and must attempt a Fortitude saving throw. A target that fails is sickened for the duration. One who succeeds is sickened for only 1 round, and then the spell ends. In either case, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the damage you dealt.

Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
