## DESCRIPTION

Whereas Burning Nail-class vessels are the Hellknights’ favored light fighters for pitched battles, the Unshakable’s design is specialized for smaller bounty-hunting operations, surgical strikes in dangerous territory, and solo scouting missions to identify new threats. With substantial armor for such a small ship, the Unshakable is able to close distance rapidly and assault even light freighters—a signature tactic. Standard operating procedure for such missions involves the Hellknight pilot then boarding their prey to subdue the crew singlehandedly.  
  
In larger groups—often referred to as interrogations—these ships instead take turns harrying their foes, with one ship entangling the group’s target as the others strafe the ensnared victim. The tether mounts on Unshakable ships are notoriously robust, and Hellknight pilots are known to blast toward cosmic hazards such as asteroid fields or unstable stars while towing especially stubborn quarries in a deadly game of chicken, daring their captives to surrender or risk mutual annihilation. There are enough confirmed incidents of Hellknights perishing in this way to convince others to heed the warning.  
  
Due to its relative rarity, the Unshakable model operated without fanfare for over 20 years. However, a nearly identical starship appeared in the recent trivid thriller The Omega Paradox, piloted by the fictional villain Paravicar Strax. The rave reviews were overshadowed only by the Hellknight attorneys’ furious cease-and-desist demands to expunge the illegal use of their craft’s likeness. In an impressive legal campaign, the Hellknights sent these terrifying demands not only to the trivid production company behind The Omega Paradox, but also to most major distributors and infosphere sites that carried it. The Hellknights eventually dropped the case, however, because the myriad Hellknight orders suddenly recognized that the trivid’s sinister depiction only enhanced their organization’s fearsome image. What’s more, the number of civilian craft that have now been custom-modified to resemble Unshakables has desensitized criminals to seeing the starship, allowing Hellknights to more effectively hide in plain sight until ready to spring their traps.  
  
There’s just one drawback to this publicity: the trivid protagonists’ action-packed exploits have encouraged unwise thrill-seekers to break into and steal unattended Unshakables. A rash of joyriding incidents prompted Hellknight engineers to include biometric locks in newer Unshakable models to thwart thefts, as well as potentially lethal countermeasures to electrocute amateur hackers who try to override the ship’s electronic defenses.
