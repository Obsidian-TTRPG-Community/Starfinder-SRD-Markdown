Effect: Like most weapon fusions designed for use on AbadarCorp weapons, the _sentinel_ fusion makes a weapon richly ornamented, sometimes even gold-plated, and often adds icons of vault doors. Favored by colonists and corporate guards, once per day a _sentinel_ weapon allows you to declare an area of up to 1,000 cubic feet as being under guard for up to 8 continuous hours. While wielding the _sentinel_ weapon within an area under guard in this manner, you gain a +2 bonus to initiative checks and Perception checks.
