# ENFORCER ARMOR
The faceless, slate-gray design of enforcer armor blends intimidation and anonymity. This heavy armor’s design echoes the aegis series’ personal tank approach, albeit with markedly inferior protection. Enforcer armor often towers a full foot over the wearer’s natural height, with most of the wearer’s head safely sheltered behind the breastplate and sensory input handled through projected video and audio feeds. Criminal organizations use enforcer armor to keep their hired muscle impersonal and enigmatic.  
  
It is difficult to distinguish different models of enforcer armor visually, so as not to betray the armor’s capabilities outside of battle. However, the lack of distinguishing features often makes enforcer armor seem like a blank canvas to warriors who cover their individual suits in unit markings, personal slogans, illustrations of mascots, and even graffiti.
