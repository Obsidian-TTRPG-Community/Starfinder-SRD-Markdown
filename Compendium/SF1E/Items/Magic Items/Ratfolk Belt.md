### Description

Ysoki are skilled at negotiating the cramped corridors of a starship or the access tunnels in a sprawling metropolis, but even the smallest ysoki sometimes encounter openings too small to enter. While wearing a _ratfolk belt_, you can move through an area as small as one-quarter your space without squeezing or one-eighth your space when squeezing. A _ratfolk belt_ is made of stretchable nylon webbing, and it often includes clips for tools or weapons.
