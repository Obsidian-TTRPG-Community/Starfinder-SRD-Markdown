##  ARROW, DIAMOND-EDGE

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 55_  
**Level** 12; **Price** 5,200  
**Hands** 1; **Proficiency** Ammo  
**Damage** —; **Critical** —  
**Capacity** 20  
**Bulk** L; **Special** 3d6 p

### DESCRIPTION

For those who want to deal greater damage with a bow but don't want the noise and collateral damage of grenade arrows, conventional arrows are available with technological improvements to deal additional damage, including diamond-edge and molecular rift arrows. When used as ammunition for weapons other than the 1st-level bow (such as crossbolters), these arrows don't increase damage, but diamond-edge arrows gain the wound critical hit effect and molecular rift arrows gain the severe wound critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon's normal critical hit effect or the effect granted by the arrow.
