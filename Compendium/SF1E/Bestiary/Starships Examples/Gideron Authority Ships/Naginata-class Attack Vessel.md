## Description

While the Gideron Authority values a distributed offensive, they coordinate attacks when necessary. Crews of Naginata-Class Attack Vessels are highly trained in syncing with nearby ships to manage the most effective maneuvers possible.

### Special Abilities

**Command Presence** When a Naginata-Class Attack Vessel is within 5 hexes of at least two other Gideron Authority starships, those starships can use the Naginata-Class Attack Vessel’s Piloting check for the helm phase.
