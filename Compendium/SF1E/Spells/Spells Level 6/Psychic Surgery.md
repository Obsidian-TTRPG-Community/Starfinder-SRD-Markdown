## Description

_Psychic surgery_ heals the target of all Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from the target’s Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. It also eliminates all ongoing confusion, fear, and insanity effects. _Psychic surgery_ also removes any mental afflictions that could be removed with _dispel magic_, as well as mental diseases. _Psychic surgery_ removes all effects magically altering the target’s memory, even instantaneous effects, and it can restore a memory to perfect clarity (even if the memory loss is due to the mundane passage of time).
