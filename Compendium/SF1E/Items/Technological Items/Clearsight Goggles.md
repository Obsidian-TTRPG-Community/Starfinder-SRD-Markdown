### Description

Those who explore environments obscured by fog, foliage, smoke, and other vision-impairing elements value clearsight goggles, a set of tight-fitting eyewear that can be worn under a helmet or even other eyewear. While you wear the goggles, fog, smoke, and similar gases don’t grant targets concealment from you, and vegetation doesn’t either. The trinket provides no benefit against a target with total concealment.
