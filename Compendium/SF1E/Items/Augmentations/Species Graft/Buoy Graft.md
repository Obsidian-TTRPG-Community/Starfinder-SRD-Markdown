Most vlakas are acutely attuned to the emotional states of others, and with a well-timed word or a knowing glance they can bolster their allies. Augmentations to the empathic regions of your neural system emulate this trait, allowing you to identify the perfect time to encourage your allies. As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to restore 1 Resolve Point to an ally within 30 feet. You can’t use this ability again until you have taken a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. This is a sense-dependent, mind-affecting effect.
