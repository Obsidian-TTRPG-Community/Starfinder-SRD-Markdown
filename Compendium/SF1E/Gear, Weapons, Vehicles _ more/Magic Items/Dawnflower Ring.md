### DESCRIPTION

This beautiful ring is made of tiny copper and gold petals that blossom into a flower that cradles a brilliant topaz, and although these rings are most often attributed to Sarenrae’s faith, secular versions also exist. As a standard action while holding or touching a light-producing object with the ringed hand, you can increase the light level produced by the object by one step (to a maximum of bright light) until the end of your next turn. If you spend 1 Resolve Point when activating the ring, you instead increase the light level produced for 1d4 minutes. If you break contact with the light-producing object, this effect ends.
