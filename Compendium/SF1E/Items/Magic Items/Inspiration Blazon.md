### Description

Inspiration can play a large part in success, and as such some leaders wear magical symbols to inspire their allies during tough situations. An _inspiration blazon_ is a decorated medal or tabard that lets you lend your allies your Resolve.  
  
An _inspiration blazon_ must be worn prominently to function. When an ally within 60 feet of you spends Resolve Points, as a reaction while you are wearing an _inspiration blazon_, you can activate the blazon to inspire that ally, provided that you can see and be heard by the ally. You speak words of encouragement and spend up to 2 Resolve Points to reduce the number of Resolve Points your ally spends by the amount you spent, to a minimum of 0. The blazon has no effect on an ally who has no Resolve Points. An _inspiration blazon_ can’t affect a given ally again until that ally regains Resolve Points during an 8-hour rest.
