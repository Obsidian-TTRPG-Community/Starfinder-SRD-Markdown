### DESCRIPTION

Most commonly used by those brave enough to travel to the high-gravity world of Aucturn, this belt uses a form of graviton levitation to essentially reduce gravitational pull. You can activate the belt as a swift action, and it operates until you spend another swift action to deactivate it or until it runs out of charges. You treat areas of extreme gravity as having high gravity, areas of high gravity as having standard gravity, and areas of standard gravity as having low gravity. This belt has no effect in areas that naturally have low gravity or zero gravity.
