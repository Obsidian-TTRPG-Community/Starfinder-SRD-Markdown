# Force Palms

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 92_  
**Level**:: 14
**Price**::  69500 
**System**:: All hands  
Arcane nodes implanted in your palms can generate fields of force energy. As a full action, you can create a globe of force that functions as _resilient sphere_ but contains only you. The effect has a duration of concentration, to a maximum of 1 minute. Alternatively, as a full action, you can attempt to place another creature that is your size or smaller within a globe of force that is just large enough for the creature to fit in without squeezing. To do so, you must hit that creature with a melee attack against its EAC; instead of adding your Strength modifier to this attack roll, you can add your key ability score modifier if it is higher. Once you use your _force palms_, you can’t use them again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.
