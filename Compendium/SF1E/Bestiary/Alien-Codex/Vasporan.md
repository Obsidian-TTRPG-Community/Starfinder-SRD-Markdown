## Vasporan Cr 9

Vasporans are ambush predators capable of molting at highly accelerated rates. They use this molting ability for both offense and defense. A vasporan can molt select parts of its body to create large, balloon-like sacs it can use to catch air currents to fly. In environments where wind is minimal or unreliable, a vasporan can also produce internal gases to fill these sacs and thus create independent lift. The vasporan uses its flight to ambush creatures from a great height. In cases when its ambush fails or the vasporan itself is the subject of an attack, it molts as a means to escape injury. A vasporan can produce a reactive agent that causes its molted skin to instantly harden when exposed to air. This tough, molted shell serves as a distraction and can even intercept an attack in dire situations.
A vasporan’s highly sensitive sense of smell warns it of approaching predators, and it’s also useful in detecting prey from great distances between various layers of thick gases. In addition using their molting capabilities to escape, vasporans molt their shells as a distraction. In most cases, vasporans molt after a failed ambush to make it difficult for the would-be prey to know where the vasporans have gone. The creatures also mark their territories with dozens of brittle moltings, both as a warning to other creatures and as an early detection system—a vasporan shell makes a distinct crackling and popping sound when it’s stepped on or destroyed that can alert the former owner when danger is approaching.
In recent years, xenobiologists have posited that some particularly hardy specimens are able to produce a unique mix of gases that can both accelerate them to the high speeds needed to reach nearby planets and provide them with breathable air on the journey. Such exceptional vasporans are thought to be rare, but vasporan broods on other planets are nonetheless becoming more common, and many species are now having to learn to contend with these dangerous creatures.
A typical vasporan is 11 feet long and weighs 750 pounds.
