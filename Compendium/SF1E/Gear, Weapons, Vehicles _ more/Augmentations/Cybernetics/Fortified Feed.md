# FORTIFIED FEED
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 88_  
**Item Level** 4; **Price** 1,850; **System** All feet  
Built from a matrix of adamantine alloy prisms and regenerative ligaments, these feet are able to withstand significant punishment. You gain DR 5/— and energy resistance 5 against ground-based [[Starship Combat Hazards]] that would harm you as you walk over them, such as electrified floors created by a computer’s [[Shock]] grid defensive countermeasure, spikes, or puddles of acid.
