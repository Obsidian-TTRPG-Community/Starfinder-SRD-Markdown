## DESCRIPTION

This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, shutter, or window of any standard material (metal, plastic, stone, wood, and so on), or it reinforces an electronic lock. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A _knock_ spell or a successful _dispel magic_ spell can negate a _hold portal_ spell.

Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal or hacking an electronic lock affected by this spell.
