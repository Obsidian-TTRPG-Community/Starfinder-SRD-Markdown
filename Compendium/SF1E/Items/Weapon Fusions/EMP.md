Effect: The EMP weapon fusion gives the weapon an electromagnetic pulse critical hit effect. When this effect triggers, the target’s worn and wielded technology, including weapons without the analog special property, armor environmental protections, powered armor, and technological and hybrid items, cease functioning for 1 round. A technological construct struck by this effect must succeed at a Reflex save or be staggered for 1 round. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the EMP effect.
