# AMBUSHER
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 19_  
The ambusher fighting style focuses on stealth, tactical positioning, and superior reflexes to gain an edge. You must have Stealth as a class skill to select this fighting style.

## VIGILANCE (EX) - 1ST LEVEL

You watch for danger and respond swiftly. You gain Improved Initiative as a bonus feat. Whenever you act before an enemy during the first round of combat, you gain a +1 insight bonus to weapon attack rolls against that enemy until the beginning of your next turn.  

## CHEAP SHOT (EX) - 5TH LEVEL

When you are hidden from a target or when you have improved or total cover against a target, as a full action you can make one ranged attack against that target that deals additional damage equal to half your Dexterity bonus.  

## DEADLY REFLEXES (EX) - 9TH LEVEL

When an enemy attacks you before you have taken any actions in combat, you can use your quick reflexes to retaliate. As a reaction, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make one attack with a ranged weapon you are wielding immediately after the enemy’s attack.  

## EXPLOIT COVER (EX) - 13TH LEVEL

When you attempt a Stealth check to hide from an enemy that can see you, you gain a +4 insight bonus to the check if you can move into improved or total cover. In addition, whenever you attempt a Stealth check to hide while sniping, the penalty to your Stealth check is only –10.  

## AMBUSHER’S EDGE (EX) - 17TH LEVEL

As a full action, you can make one attack that, in addition to dealing its normal damage and effects, causes the target to gain the off-target condition until the end of its next turn. You can also use this ability as a standard action against any creature that is flat-footed.
