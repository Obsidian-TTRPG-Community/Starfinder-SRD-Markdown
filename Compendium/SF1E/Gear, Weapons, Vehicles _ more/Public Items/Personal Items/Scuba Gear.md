### DESCRIPTION

This ensemble includes a wet suit, fins for your feet, a transparent mask, a snorkel, and an integrated tank of compressed air. As long as you are not encumbered, while wearing scuba gear, you can move at your full land speed through water and similar fluids with a successful Athletics check to swim. In addition, the air tank allows you to breathe for up to 1 hour while submerged. Scuba gear does not provide any other environmental protections. It takes 4 rounds to don or remove scuba gear. You canâ€™t wear scuba gear while wearing any type of armor.
