### Description

For those who refuse to surrender glamor, even while the world is exploding around them. Luxury evacuation yachts are the preferred escape solution for the ultra-rich. They sacrifice utility, durability, and carrying capacity to ensure that those who can afford them wait for rescue in luxury, with full beds, stocked larders, a shower, and a culinary synthesizer. Due to their size, a single yacht takes the space of an entire rack of more standard escape pods.
