# Glass Skin

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 2 pg. 65_  
**Level**:: 4
**Price**::  2000 
**System**:: Skin  
This biotech modification covers your skin with tiny, clear scales that shimmer with rainbows, as if you were constantly encased in a thin layer of ice or glass. Once per day, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to become temporarily invisible (as the _invisibility_ spell) for up to 1 minute.
