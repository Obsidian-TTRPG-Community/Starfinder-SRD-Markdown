# COUNTERMEASURE - WIPE

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 215_  
**Price** 10 credits; **Type** Countermeasure  
The system deletes specified data when an unauthorized breach is detected. This usually causes a number of data modules to be deleted from the system. Unless the owner is incredibly paranoid, this countermeasure is usually set to trigger only after two or more failed attempts to enter the system (so as to prevent accidental deletion due to a failed password attempt). Wipes donâ€™t definitively remove data, however, unless the physical module containing the data is destroyed. Information deleted through a wipe can be recovered with 8 hours of work and a successful Computers check (DC = 10 + the DC to hack the computer). A wipe countermeasure costs 10 credits.
