# Heavy Onslaught 
(Ex; 11th Level)
source: Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 112
Your attacks with heavy weapons bypass part of the target’s damage reduction. If your heavy weapon does not already overcome the target’s damage reduction, treat the target’s damage reduction as though it were 5 lower. At 15th level, treat the target’s damage reduction as 10 lower.
