# COLVEARE HIERARCH
Those who amass extraordinary wealth, power, and influence often use them to perpetuate their advantages, typically through violent or coercive means. Tyrants might maintain their rule through subterfuge and surveillance or through age-old and expedient threats and brute force. What unifies tyrants across philosophical and ideological divides is the willingness and ruthlessness to pursue extraordinarily ends to justify their means, often at a terrible cost to those who dare oppose them.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Zhufera Visions (Su)** As a standard action, the hierarch can psychically project terrifying visions that affect any number of creatures within 60 feet. Each affected creature attempts a Will save (DC = 8 + the hierarch’s CR). If they fail, they’re staggered for 1 round and shaken for 1d4 rounds. If they succeed, they’re shaken for 1 round. After being affected by this ability, a creature is immune to that hierarch’s zhufera visions for 1 hour. This is a mind-affecting ability.

## DESCRIPTION

The astriapi home world Colveare is run by a council called the Hierarchs, descended from revolutionary warrior-priests. While Colveare today is a peaceful marvel of civic engineering, a few ambitious Hierarch outliers found conspiracies, cults, or private armies to rule unequivocally. While these aspirations often take the Hierarch far from home, a few aspire to overthrow Colveare’s government and install themselves as absolute monarchs.
