# Phasing

This ammunition is tipped with quantum-variable molecules, allowing it to phase through many materials prior to impacting with its target. If you take a move action to aim and then fire on the same turn a weapon with phasing ammo (including doing so with a sniper weapon), the attack ignores any cover the target has with a hardness equal to given value or less (hardness 10 for 7th-level rounds, hardness 20 for 14th-level rounds). The rounds literally bypass the cover, doing no damage to it.

### Special Weapons

Special weapons resist classification into any other category. Some adventurers favor special weapons for the abilities they offer or for their unique beauty.
