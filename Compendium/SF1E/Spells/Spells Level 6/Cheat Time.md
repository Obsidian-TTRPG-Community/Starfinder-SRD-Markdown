## DESCRIPTION

You unfetter yourself in time, rapidly performing a variety of actions in the blink of an eye. You can perform up to six actions from the following options, in a combination and order of your choice, though some actions end the spell immediately.

**Attack**: You can perform an attack with any weapon you're wielding. After you perform this action, _cheat time_ immediately ends, eliminating any unused actions.

**Combat Maneuver**: You can perform a bull rush, dirty trick, disarm, or trip combat maneuver. When you attempt these combat maneuvers, you can use your key ability modifier instead of your Strength modifier if it's higher.

**Manipulate Object**: You can manipulate an object within reach.

**Move**: You can move up to your speed. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Spell**: You can cast a spell with a casting time of 1 standard action. After you perform this action, if the spell you cast is offensive, _cheat time_ immediately ends, eliminating any unused actions.
