ABOUT

Slavers have always existed, preying on the weak and disenfranchised. They look for any easy targets in areas with poor law enforcement. Once captured, they bring their slaves to market on worlds where slavery is legal. Most slavers hunt in packs, traveling on transport vessels configured for moving herds of slaves. Slavers are the scourge of free societies, capturing the innocent and spiriting them away to mines, plantations, and pleasure palaces on distant worlds.
