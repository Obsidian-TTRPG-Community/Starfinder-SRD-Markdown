ECOLOGY

**Environment** any  
**Organization** solitary, grove (1 plus 1-3 erahthi slayers)

Erahthi slayers are found across the Aethera System. Those encountered on Kir-Sharaat are typically under the employ of the erahthi government, operating as spies and assassins ensuring the safety of their homeworld. When encountered off of Kir-Sharaat, erahthi slayers might be expatriate assassins for hire, mercenaries, or secret agents of the Tritarch carrying out long-term assignments.

An erahthi slayer is a versatile opponent, able to move between ranged and melee combat with ease. Most do not possess the force of presence to communicate with plants, as many of their kind can, and feel less of an innate connection to nature. This is, perhaps, why they are so quick to adapt to alien technologies like aethertech.
