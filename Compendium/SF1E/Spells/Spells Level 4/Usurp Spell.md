## Description

You override the will of another spellcaster, taking control of their spell. As a reaction when you observe a spell being cast within range, you can cast this spell. If you do, you can attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level). The DC equals 11 + the other spellcaster's caster level + 2 per level of the spell above 4th. If you succeed, you determine the spell's parameters as if you had cast it. This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.
