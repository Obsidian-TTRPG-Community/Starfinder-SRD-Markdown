# Nanocyte Knacks

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 13_  
You learn your first nanocyte knack at 2nd level and an additional knack every 2 levels thereafter. Nanocyte knacks all require you to meet a minimum nanocyte level, and they're organized accordingly. Some nanocyte knacks require you to satisfy other prerequisites, such as having other knacks. For effects that require a saving throw, the DC is 10 + half your nanocyte level + your Constitution modifier.

## 2ND Level

You must be at least 2nd level to select these nanocyte knacks.  

### Abundant Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 13_  
Your body houses a seemingly inexhaustible amount of nanites. When calculating your number of nanite surges per day and the maximum bulk of your nanite gear, treat your Constitution modifier as 2 higher.

### Agile Host (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
While your sheath array is active, you can apply its bonus to skill checks as an insight bonus to your initiative checks.

### Cushioning Form (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
You manipulate your nanites to slow your descent and cushion you from falls. While your sheath array is active, you treat falls as 20 feet shorter. You can use a nanite surge as a reaction to instead treat falls as 60 feet shorter for 1 round.

### Drifting Host (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Whether pulled by waves or other forces, you’re used to drifting far from your nanites and can control them at further distances. The distance you can be from your nanites at the end of your turn before they disperse increases to 15 feet. At 10th level, this distance increases to 20 feet, and at 18th level, to 25 feet.

### Esoteric Edge (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
You gain proficiency with two special weapons, you can select special weapons when learning new major forms, and you learn one special weapon as a bonus major form. At 3rd level, you gain weapon specialization in the two selected weapons just as if your class granted proficiency.

### Glimmering Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites emit pinpricks of colorful light. Your nanite cloud sheds dim light in its space and each space adjacent to it. You can suppress or activate this light as a move action. This light can be used to communicate in Lumos and other light-based visual languages you know.

### Heavy Armor Edge (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
Your nanites allow you to move comfortably while wearing thick gear. You gain proficiency with heavy armor, and you treat the bulk of heavy armor you wear as 1 lower.

### Instant Ward (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 27_  
Your nanites can inscribe magical sigils, creating temporary wards against supernatural beings. As a standard action while y o u r eldritch array or cloud array is active, you can direct your nanites to create a protective ward in a 5-foot square. This ward must be created on a stable surface, such as a wall or floor, and it is clearly visible. If your eldritch array is active, this ward appears in one square you occupy. If your cloud array is active, the ward appears in one square your cloud array occupies. When you or an ally stand in the warded square, that creature gains a +1 divine bonus to AC and saving throws against the attacks, spells, and abilities of fey, outsiders, and undead. If a fey, outsider, or undead who is not your ally enters or ends their turn in the warded square, they take a –1 penalty to AC and saving throws. Either effect lasts as long as the creature remains in the warded area and until the end of their next turn if they leave the warded area.  
A space remains warded for 1 minute, until it is no longer adjacent to (or within) your nanite array, or until you create a new ward.

### Insulating Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites can absorb or emit heat to regulate your body temperature. Whenever you activate your nanite sheath, select hot or cold weather; your nanites can protect you from cold or heat, but not both simultaneously. Your nanite sheath reduces the severity of the selected dangerous temperature by one step. At 10th level, your nanites instead reduce the severity of dangerous temperatures by two steps.

### Myriad Forms (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
You learn three additional minor forms that you can create with your nanite array.

### Otherworldly Nanites (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 27_  
Your nanites channel otherworldly powers. Choose a class that has the spells class feature. You gain a limited version of that class’s spells class feature rather than the technomancer’s spells class feature, replacing any technomancer spells you know from the eldritch nanites alternate class feature with spells from the chosen class’s spell list. In addition, you gain one additional 0-level spell known for your eldritch nanites.  
You must have the eldritch nanites alternate class feature to select this knack.

### Split Manifestation (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
When using your gear array to form an operative weapon or small arm, you can manifest a second copy of that weapon. This counts as only one array for determining the number of arrays you have active.

### Surgical Host (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
While your sheath array is active, you can perform Medicine checks on creatures within your reach. While you’re within reach of your cloud array, you can also perform Medicine checks on creatures in or adjacent to the cloud as though they were within your reach. For both forms, you perform Medicine checks as though you’re using a basic medkit; at 5th level, you instead perform Medicine checks as though you’re using an advanced medkit. At 8th level, you can select a medical lab as one of your minor forms known

### Swarm Strike (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
When you form your sheath array, you can use a nanite surge to gain a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, lacks the archaic trait, and has an item level equal to your nanocyte level. You can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier for attack and damage rolls for this attack. Using a swarm strike requires you to have at least one hand free. For each attack, you can deal bludgeoning damage, piercing damage, slashing damage, or any two of these damage types. At 3rd level, you gain a unique weapon specialization with your swarm strike, adding 1-1/2 × your nanocyte level to its damage rolls (instead of just adding your character level). At 7th level, this unarmed strike gains the thrown (20 feet) special property, and while you have at least two hands free, your weapon specialization damage bonus with this weapon increases to 2 × your level. At 11th level, while you have at least two hands free, your swarm strike gains the reach special property. At 15th level, the range increment of your thrown swarm strike increases to 40 feet, and it increases to 60 feet at 19th level. You can use this ability only while your sheath array is active.

### Versatile Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
You’ve learned to direct your nanites in assisting you with difficult tasks, such as identifying damage, stitching wounds, reshaping your features, or further tuning your reflexes. Choose two of the following skills: Bluff, Disguise, Engineering, Medicine, Perception, or Piloting. You add these skills as options to which you can apply your sheath array’s insight bonus to skill checks. You can select this knack multiple times, each time selecting different skills.

### Cushioning Sheath (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
You’re instinctively able to gather your nanite array beneath you to help break your fall when said fall would otherwise break you. When your sheath array is active, the surface on which you fall always counts as yielding (Core Rulebook400), converting the damage from the first 10 feet of a fall to nonlethal bludgeoning damage. In addition, when your sheath array is active, for every 5 by which your Acrobatics check exceeds the DC to avoid taking damage from the first 10 feet of a fall, you can ignore the damage from an additional 10 feet of falling.

### Split Cloud (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
You’ve learned to keep your nanites functioning even when they’re separated by currents or environmental factors. Your cloud array can have a gap of one 5-foot square between the spaces it fills. At 10th level, this increases to two 5-foot squares, and at 18th level, this increases to three 5-foot squares. Even if split into multiple smaller clouds by these gaps, the cloud functions as one unit. When reconfiguring the spaces your cloud occupies, at least one square of each smaller cloud must remain unchanged.

## 6TH Level

You must be at least 6th level to select these nanocyte knacks.  

### Camouflaging Sheath (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites can alter their color and appearance, settling on your flesh in a variety of patterns and colors, providing you camouflage in your surroundings. When you attempt a Stealth check while your sheath array is active, you can use a move action to increase the insight bonus to your Stealth check by 2 until the end of your turn. You can additionally use a nanite surge to hide in plain sight.

### Enhanced Immunities (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
Your nanites reinforce your body, staving off even grave threats to your health. If you succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against an effect that has a reduced effect on a successful save, you instead avoid the effect entirely.

### Extensive Reach (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
You have precise control over your nanites and can use them to extend your reach. Your sheath array increases your natural reach by 5 feet.

### Facial Reconfiguration (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
Your nanites can harmlessly reshape your body in increasingly dramatic ways. While your sheath array is active, you can use the Disguise skill to change your appearance with 1d3 minutes of work; you can use one nanite surge to reduce this required time to a full action. You reduce one of the check’s DC modifiers by an amount equal to half your nanocyte level (to a minimum of +0), though this reduction applies only to disguises that change your appearance in the following ways: add major features, disguise yourself as a different race of the same creature type, or disguise yourself as a different creature type.  
You must have the versatile nanites knack and have selected Disguise as one of the affected skills to select this knack.

### Heavy Weapon Edge (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
You know how to deal damage with big weapons. You gain proficiency with heavy weapons, and you gain weapon specialization in heavy weapons just as if your class granted proficiency. When you gain this knack, you can replace one of your major forms known with that of a heavy weapon. You add your Constitution modifier to your Strength score for the purpose of wielding heavy weapons formed from your gear array without penalty.

### Hungry Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 14_  
Your nanites tear and gnaw on creatures you designate. After a creature takes damage in your nanite cloud or you damage a creature within 30 feet with a weapon formed with your gear array, you can take a reaction to cause the creature to gain the bleeding 1d6 condition (Fortitude negates). The amount of bleed damage increases to 1d10 at 10th level, 2d8 at 14th level, and 3d8 at 18th level. While the bleeding creature is within your cloud array, the Medicine DC to stop the bleeding condition increases by an amount equal to half your nanocyte level plus your Constitution modifier. After using this ability, you can’t use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.

### Instant Architect (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
You gain Barricade as a bonus feat. You can use Barricade to create a barrier within your nanite cloud rather than just in an adjacent space.  
In addition, as a full action, you can use a nanite surge to shape your nanites into a temporary structure: a ladder up to 30 feet long, a door sealing an opening up to 10 feet square, a 10-foot-radius hemispherical shelter, or a 5-foot-wide bridge that spans up to 40 feet. This counts against the number of arrays you can have active. Regardless of the structure’s form, it has a number of Hit Points equal to your level, hardness equal to your Constitution modifier, and a break DC of 10.

### Neutralizing Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites can release a dense liquid sealant that douses flames and seals open wounds. While your sheath array is active you gain a +2 bonus to Medicine checks made to end the bleeding condition and Reflex saves made to end the burning condition. When you fail a check to end the bleeding or burning condition, you can use a nanite surge as a reaction to reroll the failed check or saving throw.

### Sensory Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Nothing that disturbs your nanite cloud escapes your attention. You gain blindsense (vibration) with a range of 5 feet. This blindsense also extends to any area in or adjacent to your cloud array.

### Telepathic Cloud (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites contain an advanced communications array that transmits your thoughts directly into the minds of those nearby, enabling you to telepathically communicate in environments and situations where a language would be impossible to visually or audibly articulate, such as using Lumos in bright sunlight or audible languages in Luminar’s dense, gaseous seas. You can communicate telepathically with any creatures within the area of your cloud array with whom you share a language.

### Aquatic Propulsion (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
Your nanites propel your weapons with great force, pushing through water and dense gases without difficulty. Each time you form a weapon using your gear array, you can apply the underwater weapon special property to that weapon (when used underwater, it ignores the –2 penalty to attack rolls and deals full damage). If you do, combat maneuvers you attempt using that weapon gain a +1 bonus.

### Hampering Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
Your nanites seize and hobble your foes, restricting their movement. After a creature takes damage in your nanite cloud or you damage a creature within 30 feet with a weapon formed with your gear array, you can take a reaction to cause the creature to become entangled (Reflex negates) for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier, or until it escapes with an Acrobatics check or a Strength check. An entangled creature can attempt such a check as a move action. After using this ability, you can’t use it again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.

### Vehicular Array (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
You’ve learned to transform your nanites into basic vehicles to help you maneuver various terrain. When you use your gear array to take a major form, you can use a nanite surge to instead form your nanites into a basic enercycle that only you can ride. This otherwise follows the standard rules for your gear array. At 10th level, you can form your nanites into a torpedo minisub, and at 14th level, you can form your nanites into an ultralight turboglider (Armory 139). Regardless of the form, these vehicles offer no cover, can’t carry passengers, have no hardness, deal no collision damage, and have 1 HP.

## 10TH Level

You must be at least 10th level to select these nanocyte knacks.  

### Adaptable Weaponry (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Your nanites capably innovate new features when you manifest nanite weapons. Choose two of the following special weapon properties: block, bright, deflect, feint, grapple, harrying, penetrating, stun, sunder, or trip. Each time you form a weapon using your gear array, you can apply one of the selected special weapon properties to that weapon. You can select this knack multiple times; each time, select two additional special weapon properties and add them to the list of available properties (you still apply only one at a time).

### Alacritous Form (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Your nanite sheath increases your land speed by 10 feet. This increases to 15 feet at 14th level and 20 feet at 18th level. Once per day at the beginning of your turn, you can use one nanite surge to gain the benefits of haste until the beginning of your next turn.

### All-seeing Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Your nanites’ sensors are especially acute. You gain blindsight (vibration) with a range of 5 feet. This blindsight also extends to any area in or adjacent to your nanite cloud.  
As a reaction, after you touch a target, strike a target with a weapon formed with your gear array, or are hit by an adjacent creature, you can use a nanite surge to adhere a tiny mass of nanites to that creature or object; a creature can attempt a Reflex save to negate this effect. These nanites resonate with the rest of your nanite array, allowing you to sense the target as though you had blindsight (vibration) with a range of 120 feet. In addition, you can track the target with a base DC of 10 regardless of the surface conditions, and you can use Perception in place of Survival to track the target. The tracking nanites remain active for a number of days equal to your Constitution modifier.  
You must have the sensory nanites knack to select this knack.

### Anchored Cloud (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites are accustomed to maintaining their position regardless of external pressure and motion. Spaces occupied by your cloud array are difficult terrain.

### Beguiling Array (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 26_  
Your nanites can mimic and amplify your natural glow. When you use beguiling glow while your cloud array is active, your beguiling glow emanates from all the spaces your cloud array fills, as well as from you. You can use one nanite surge when you activate beguiling glow to increase the radius of your beguiling glow to 30 feet and change its DC to that of your nanocyte knacks. You must have the beguiling glow species trait and the glimmering nanites knack to select this nanocyte knack.

### Biometric Theft (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Your nanites can modify your features in subtle ways, allowing you to attempt a Disguise check in place of a Computers or Engineering check to defeat biometric locks and similar safeguards. As a reaction when you hit a creature with a melee attack or touch them, you can use a nanite surge to absorb a sample of the target’s DNA or other code. You can store a number of samples equal to your Constitution modifier at any time, and each sample remains viable for a number of days equal to your Constitution modifier. If you absorb another sample and exceed this maximum, you erase one sample of your choice.  
You gain a +5 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks to bypass biometric safeguards keyed to any creature whose sample you have. In addition, if you have the facial reconfiguration knack you can use it to take the appearance of any creatures whose samples you have.  
This instead grants a +10 circumstance bonus to the Disguise check. In addition, facial reconfiguration reduces the check’s DC modifier for this disguise by an amount equal to your nanocyte level (to a minimum of +0), applied to any of the check’s modifiers

### Defensive Doppelganger (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
When you create a cloud array, you can use a nanite surge to cause a portion of your cloud array to form a lifelike replica of you that shadows and mimics your movements, functioning like a single figment image created by mirror image. The duplicate exists until it’s destroyed or you leave the cloud’s area. At 14th level, you create 1d2 images, and at 18th level, you create 1d4 images.

### Exhausting Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 27_  
Your nanites utilize electrical pulses to cause exhausting muscle spasms and electrical interference. Weapons you form with your gear array gain the fatigue critical hit effect. Once per day, after you damage a creature with a weapon formed from your gear array, you can use a nanite surge as a reaction to impose the effects of slow on the target (Fortitude negates) for a number of rounds equal to half your Constitution bonus. Creatures immune to electricity are immune to exhausting nanites.

### Feasting Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Your nanites break down and repurpose your foes’ vital fluids to fuel their host. Whenever the target of your hungry nanites takes bleed damage from that ability and is within 30 feet of you, you regain an equal number of Stamina Points. Until you next take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, you can regain a maximum number of Stamina Points in this way equal to 3 times your nanocyte level. You must have the hungry nanites knack to select this knack.

### Group Dispersal (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 15_  
Your nanites protect your companions as readily as they protect you. You can use your defensive dispersal on any ally you can see who’s adjacent to you or within your cloud array. When you use your defensive dispersal on yourself, any adjacent allies also gain the benefits of that ability against the triggering attack or effect. However, only you benefit from additional knacks or other abilities that provide any additional effects when you use defensive dispersal.

### Nanomagical Font (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 27_  
You gain 2 additional nanite surges per day that can be used only to gain additional spell slots to cast your spells gained by the eldritch nanites ability. Whenever you spend nanite surges to gain a spell slot, you regain Stamina Points equal to twice the number of nanite surges you spent.

### Ninefold Ward (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 27_  
When you activate your instant ward knack with your eldritch array, the ward covers a 15-foot-by-15-foot square centered on your space. When you activate your instant ward knack with your cloud array, the ward affects each square affected by your cloud array.  
You must have the instant ward knack to select this knack.

### Rapid Reshape (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
Every 1d4 rounds, you can form or switch nanite arrays as a swift action without using a nanite surge.

### Shock Absorption (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 27_  
Your nanites can disperse electrical currents throughout their volume. While your sheath array is active, or while you’re standing within the area of your cloud array, you have electricity resistance 5. When you would take electricity damage, you can use a nanite surge as a reaction to increase this resistance by an amount equal to your nanocyte level plus your Constitution bonus until the end of your next turn.

### Thousand Stitches (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
You can use the surgical host knack to perform Medicine checks to treat deadly wounds as a standard action. If you succeed at this check, you restore 2 Hit Points per level or CR of the creature you’re treating. If you exceed the DC by 5 or more, you add your Intelligence bonus and Constitution bonus to the amount healed.  
You must have the surgical host knack to select this knack.

### Adaptable Augmentations (EX)

**Source**:: *Ports of Call pg. 103*
You can temporarily alter the systems of your body to accept almost any augmentation. When you use your gear array to create a cybernetic augmentation, you can install it into any empty body slot, regardless of where it would normally be installed. If this augmentation takes up multiple slots, you must have the requisite number of empty body slots or the augmentation fails to manifest.

### Exploratory Form (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
You’re driven to explore diverse environments and worlds. While your sheath array is active, you can use a nanite surge to gain either a climb speed of 30 feet or a swim speed of 30 feet. If you already have the selected speed, you instead increase that speed by 15 feet. This lasts for a number of hours equal to your Constitution modifier. You lose this speed when your sheath array ends.

## 14TH Level

You must be at least 14th level to select these nanocyte knacks.  

### Charge Vampire (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
When you damage a creature in your nanite cloud or when you damage a creature within 30 feet using a weapon formed with your gear array, you can drain power from the target’s technological devices as a reaction. Choose one item in the target’s possession that uses charges or select a qualifying item at random. That item loses a number of charges equal to 1d10 plus your Constitution modifier (Fortitude half), and a battery in your possession gains an equal number of charges (to a maximum of the battery’s capacity). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier.

### Deconstructor (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
Weapons you form with your gear array and your faculty abilities deal additional damage equal to your Constitution modifier to constructs, objects, and creatures with the technological subtype. In addition, these attacks and abilities ignore an amount of hardness equal to your nanocyte level. This hardness reduction doesn’t stack with that of the penetrating weapon property but instead increases the weapon’s item level by an amount equal to your Constitution modifier for the purpose of calculating the amount of hardness the weapon ignores.

### Luminous Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 27_  
Your nanites are luminous beacons that can flash brightly. The light shed by your nanite cloud increases in intensity, shedding bright light instead of dim light. You can use a nanite surge as a swift action to overcharge your nanites, causing them to flare brightly. Each creature within your nanite cloud must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded until the end of its next turn. A creature that succeeds at its Fortitude save is instead dazzled for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution bonus. After your nanites flare in this way, they go dark and can’t shed illumination of any kind until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10 minute rest. You must have the glimmering nanites knack to select this knack.

### Menacing Pall (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
Your cloud array becomes a deadly fog that can strike those within from any angle. While you’re adjacent to or within your nanite cloud, you can make melee attacks with weapons formed with your gear array from any square occupied by your nanite cloud. This allows you to gain position-based benefits such as avoiding cover or flanking an enemy. This ability doesn’t allow you to see targets that you couldn’t otherwise perceive. You can’t use this ability to perform attacks of opportunity.

### Violent Dispersal (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 27_  
You can use your nanites to rout your foes directly. While your sheath array is active, you can use a nanite surge to send your nanites rocketing off your body with powerful force. Attempt a single bull rush combat maneuver that targets each creature within 15 feet of you; you can use your Constitution modifier for this attack roll instead of your Strength modifier. Regardless of the result of the bull rush, each creature targeted in this way takes force damage equal to your Constitution modifier. After using violent dispersal, your nanites disperse, ending your sheath array. You can’t use violent dispersal again until you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10 minute rest.

### Gluttonous Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_  
Your nanites make the most of every opportunity to regenerate. Once per day after a combat in which you defeat a significant enemy who’s no longer alive, you can direct your nanites to devour that enemy’s body; if you do so, you regain Stamina points equal to 3 times your nanocyte level. You must have the hungry nanites and feasting nanites knacks to select this knack.

## 18TH Level

You must be at least 18th level to select these nanocyte knacks.  

### Adaptive Telepathy (EX)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 27_  
Your nanites can distill your thoughts into emotional images and feelings, enabling you to communicate with those with whom you don’t share a language. You can use a nanite surge to communicate simple ideas telepathically to any creatures within the area of your cloud array, even if you don’t share a common language. This doesn’t enable you to comprehend languages spoken within the area of your cloud array that you don’t understand.

### Become Legion (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
As a move action, you can use a nanite surge to transform into a nanite fog, during which you can take no actions except those granted to you by this ability. This is a polymorph effect, and it counts against the number of arrays you can have active. While transformed, you’re a Gargantuan construct with the swarm subtype, a space of 20 feet, and a reach of 0 feet. You can occupy the same space as other creatures. As a standard action, you can make a swarm attack (1d4 piercing damage per 2 nanocyte levels) and gain swarm defenses (except immunity to single-target mind-affecting effects) and swarm immunities as per the universal creature rules (Starfinder Alien Archive 157). These immunities don’t end ongoing conditions. When dealing swarm damage to creatures in your space, you can avoid damaging a number of creatures up to your Constitution modifier.  
This transformation lasts until the beginning of your next turn, at which point you can attempt a DC 30 Fortitude saving throw. If you succeed, the transformation’s duration extends to the beginning of your next turn. If you fail, the transformation ends, and you re-form in any space your swarm body occupied. The DC of this saving throw increases by 2 each time you succeed at the saving throw. If you’re reduced to 0 Hit Points, the transformation ends automatically.  
You can’t use this knack again until after you spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.

### Omnipresent Form (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
While you’re adjacent to or within your cloud array and take a guarded step, you can move a total distance equal to 5 feet plus 5 × half your Constitution modifier (rounded down) as long as your movement and destination is also entirely adjacent to or within your nanite cloud. Alternatively, you can use a nanite surge when taking a guarded step to teleport to any location so long as your starting point and destination are both adjacent to a square that contains your nanite cloud; this movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Omniscient Nanites (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
Nothing escapes the notice of your nanites. The range of your blindsight (vibration) granted by the all-seeing nanites knack increases to 20 feet. This blindsight also extends to any area to which your nanite cloud has line of effect, to a range of 20 feet. Traces of your nanite host can even penetrate solid material, granting you the sense through (blindsight \[vibration\]) ability, which is blocked by especially dense or thick materials as normal. Finally, when you apply a nanite tracker to a target using the all-seeing nanites knack, you can sense the target as though you had blindsight (vibration) with a range of a number of miles equal to your Constitution modifier. You must have the all-seeing nanites knack to select this knack.

### Sudden Transformation (EX)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 16_  
You can take a reaction to form a nanite array. After using this ability the first time each day, you must use a nanite surge each time you use it again.

### Flurrying Fog (EX)

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 103_
