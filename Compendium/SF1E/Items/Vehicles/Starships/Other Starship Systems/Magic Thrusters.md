## Magic Thrusters

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 30_  
**PCU** 0; **Cost (in BP)** 1/5 × base frame cost  
Magic thrusters use arcane energy to move a starship and can provide improved handling. Magic thrusters are purchased and installed along with typical thrusters, at an additional cost equal to 1/5 of the starship frame’s BP cost (minimum 1). Magic thrusters grant an additional +1 Piloting modifier and reduce the distance between turns by 1 (minimum 0).
