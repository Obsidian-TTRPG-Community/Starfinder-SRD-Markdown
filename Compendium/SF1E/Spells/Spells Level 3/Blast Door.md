## DESCRIPTION

You conjure a blast door up to 5 feet thick that blocks a hallway no more than 20 feet wide and 20 feet high. If the door would not completely block the targeted hallway, you can’t cast this spell. Any creature in the spaces where the door appears is harmlessly shunted to a side of the door you choose. The door’s statistics are those of a starship interior wall. It is airtight, and it protects against vacuum and radiation. When the spell ends, the door vanishes without a trace.
