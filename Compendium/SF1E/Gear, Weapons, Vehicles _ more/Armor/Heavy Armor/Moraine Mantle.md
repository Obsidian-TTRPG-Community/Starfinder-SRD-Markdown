# MORAINE MANTLE
The sturdy moraine mantle resembles the bleak, rocky tundra where it first originated, with extremely durable crystal and ceramic plating that makes its wearer appear encased in sheets of rock or ice. Born of a desire to shield wearers from large predators as well as the elements, this heavy armor is well-suited for defending a settlement or mining the icy depths, though its bulk makes it less suitable for long-range missions across the ice. An airtight crystalline visor and buoyancy contingents are built in for emergency submersion should a wearer misjudge the soundness of the surrounding terrain. The mantle’s gneiss and orogen models grant resistance 5 to cold.
