# SCLERITE HARPOONER
Kaions’ ability to reel in all manner of prey has led to emulations of their effective hunting strategy. A sclerite harpooner is inlaid with spirals of kaion shell and magnetically fires either harvested or manufactured kaion sclerites along two rails; this ammunition is available in the same quantities and at the same price as darts. As a reaction, the weapon can be activated to reel in a target affected by its embed critical hit effect. The target must attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the harpooner’s item level + the wielder’s Strength modifier) or be pulled 30 feet toward the wielder; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Huge or larger creatures are not affected.
