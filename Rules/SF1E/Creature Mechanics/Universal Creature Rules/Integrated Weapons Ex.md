# Integrated Weapons (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 3 pg. 152_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 151_  
The creature’s weapons are manufactured weapons, not natural weapons, and they are integrated into its frame. A creature can’t be disarmed of these weapons, though they can be removed and used if the creature is dead.

_Format_: **Defensive Abilities** integrated weapons.  
_Guidelines_: A manufactured weapon is a weapon with an item level that can be purchased by characters.
