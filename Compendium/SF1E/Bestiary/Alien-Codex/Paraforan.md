    desc: "Once per day as a full action, a paraforan can pulse with a shimmering light that heals it. The paraforan gains [[Fast Healing Ex|fast healing]] 15 for 1d4+1 rounds. During this time, any creature that begins its turn or moves adjacent to the paraforan must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or gain the blinded condition for 1 round.

Each non-paraforan creature within 60 feet takes 4d8+12 damage and gains the shaken condition for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 21 Will save takes half damage, isn’t shaken, and cannot be affected by the same paraforan’s shrieking chorus for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect."
