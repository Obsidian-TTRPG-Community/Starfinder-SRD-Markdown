## Description

_Lesser restoration_ dispels any magical effects reducing one of the target’s ability scores, or it heals 1d4 temporary ability damage to one of the target’s ability scores. It also eliminates any fatigue suffered by the creature or improves an exhausted condition to fatigued, but it doesn’t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. It also doesn’t heal permanent ability drain. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or the reduction of exhaustion from _lesser restoration_ can’t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.
