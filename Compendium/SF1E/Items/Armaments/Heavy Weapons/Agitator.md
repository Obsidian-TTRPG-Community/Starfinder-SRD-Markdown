# Agitator

An agitator is a portable generator of microwave radiation that rapidly heats up targets to create internal bubbles of steam or makes targets burst into flames. The longer the weapon is focused, the more intense the agitation becomes, making it a favored by the defenders of bunkers, guard posts, and other emplacements. Ember agitators and blaze agitators rely on individual generators, taking the form of a bulky cylinder in the middle of the gun that hums ominously as the weapon fires, but miniaturization technology allows inferno agitators and solar flare agitators to include multiple smaller generators for increased effect.

### Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
