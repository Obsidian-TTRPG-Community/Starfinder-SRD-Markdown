### Description

This aeon stone functions as a specialized scrying sensor that’s constantly alert for a specific trigger. Once per hour as a move action, you can task the aeon stone with watching for a specific simple stimulus such as “any Medium or larger creature,” “the sound of an approaching creature,” or “smoke.” The aeon stone constantly perceives your surroundings in a 30-foot radius with human-like senses and darkvision the stone cannot detect anything beyond that range. The stone has a +15 modifier to Life Science, Perception, or Physical Science checks to identify that assigned stimulus. If the stone senses the stimulus, it telepathically signals you, imparting information about the stimulus’s direction and distance for 1 round. The stone can provide up to three such signals per hour and no more than one per minute. The stone watches for its assigned stimulus until you deactivate the aeon stone or task it with detecting a new stimulus.
