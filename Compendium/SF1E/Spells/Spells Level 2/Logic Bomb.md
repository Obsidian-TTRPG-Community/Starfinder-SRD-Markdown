## Description

You infuse one computer system or module with protective energy, inuring it against attempts to access it.

As long as this spell is in effect, the first time a creature unsuccessfully attempts to access, destroy, or manipulate the affected computer system or module (using the Computers skill or otherwise), it takes 6d6 damage (either cold, electricity, or fire damage; you choose when casting the spell, and the spell gains the appropriate descriptor). The creature can attempt a Fortitude saving throw for half damage, and spell resistance applies. This damage is in addition to any negative effects the creature suffers due to the systemâ€™s other countermeasures.
