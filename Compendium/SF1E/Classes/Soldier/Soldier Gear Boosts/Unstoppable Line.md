# Unstoppable Line 
(Ex; 7th Level)
source: Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 27
When you strike multiple targets with a weapon with the line special property, and the effect would be stopped due to a target taking no damage, and if that target does not provide total cover to creatures farther away, the remaining targets instead take half damage if the attack hits them. Additionally, if you score a critical hit with a line weapon, you can choose which target takes the effect of the critical hit.
