Few things can strike fear into the heart of a battle-weary frontline trooper more than a Corpse Fleet mech. From a distance, they appear as mobile skeletons of some long-dead beast, but up close, a more horrifying detail becomes clear. Much like Eoxian starships, Corpse Fleet mechs contain vital systems within an ossified carapace resembling a gigantic skeleton. The coffin-like cockpit is placed with little regard to pilot safety, often wedged in between functional components like an implanted foreign organ. It isn’t uncommon for pilots to pry back cartilage and sinew to crawl into the mech for access to the cockpit. Hydraulic hoses and gore-slick cabling snake in and out of the exterior bones, piercing mysterious organs and coiling around the decaying muscle protected by the exoskeleton. Semi-organic facsimiles of battle-tested Pact World weapons are commonly integrated into peripheral bones that hang stiffly off the central body’s edges, and it isn’t unusual to see familiar-looking components grafted into the construct’s interior biology. The most protected element is the power core
this Eoxian-pioneered tech allows these mechs to pull the dying ember of life from a recently deceased creature and rip it apart into raw energy to gain a brief surge of power. As if the ghastly visage wasn’t enough to stoke fear in an enemy, audible screams of shattered souls echo from deep within the mech’s heart when running at full power.
