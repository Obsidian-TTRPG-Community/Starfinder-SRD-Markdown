# Trample (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 3 pg. 154_, _Alien Archive pg. 157_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 154_  
As a full action, the creature can move up to its speed and through the space of any creatures that are at least one size smaller than itself. The creature does not need to make an attack roll; each creature whose space it moves through takes damage. A target of a trample can attempt a Reflex save with the listed DC to take half damage; if it attempts the save, it can’t make an attack of opportunity against the trampling creature due to the creature’s movement. A creature can deal trample damage to a given target only once per round.

_Format_: **Offensive Abilities** trample (3d4+14 B, DC 16).  
_Guidelines_: The amount of damage the trample deals should be the same as the creature’s standard melee damage.
