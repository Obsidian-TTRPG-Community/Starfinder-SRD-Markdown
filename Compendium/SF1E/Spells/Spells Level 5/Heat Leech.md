## Description

You drain the heat from all creatures and objects in the area, dealing 13d8 cold damage. You can store the gathered heat energy in a used battery. If you do so and use that battery when casting _explosive blast_ within 1 minute, that spell deals 2d6 additional fire damage, destroying the used battery. Otherwise, the energy dissipates normally.
