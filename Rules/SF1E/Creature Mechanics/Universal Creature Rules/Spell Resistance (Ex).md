# SPELL RESISTANCE (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive pg. 156_  
The creature can avoid the effects of some spells and spelllike abilities that would directly affect it. To determine whether a spell or spell-like ability works against a creature with spell resistance, the caster must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + caster level). If the result equals or exceeds the creatureâ€™s spell resistance, the spell works normally, though the creature can still attempt any saving throws normally allowed. See page 265 of the _Starfinder Core Rulebook_ for more information.

_Format_: **SR** 18.
