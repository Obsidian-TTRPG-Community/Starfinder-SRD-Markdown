This modification enables a vehicle to traverse a specific terrain with ease. Select one biome (Core Rulebook 396) when you purchase this modification, such as aerial, desert, or urban. Your vehicle is unaffected by non-magical difficult terrain and rough terrain in the selected biome. A vehicle can have only one terrain adaptation modification, even if each is designed for a different biome.
