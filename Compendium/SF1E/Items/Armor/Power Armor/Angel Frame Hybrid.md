This surprisingly light suit of hybrid powered armor uses technomagical microthrusters to grant you flight and incredible mobility. In its undeployed form, an _angel frame_ looks and functions as a specific kind of clothing, often an environmental outfit or travel outfit. In this form, an _angel frame_ grants none of the effects of wearing powered armor and doesn’t use charges. As a full action, you can speak a command word that causes pieces of the armor to deploy from extra-dimensional spaces and fit together around you. Once deployed, the _angel frame_ functions as powered armor with the listed statistics. You can return the _angel frame_ to its undeployed form as a full action by speaking the same command word. An _angel frame_ that runs out of power stays in its deployed form and has a bulk of 18 you can still exit the armor as a full action.  
  
_Angel frames_ tend to resemble a gleaming suit of full plate perfectly tailored to your form, sometimes with wing-like protrusions at its shoulders its appearance can also be subtly altered to fit your personal aesthetic.
