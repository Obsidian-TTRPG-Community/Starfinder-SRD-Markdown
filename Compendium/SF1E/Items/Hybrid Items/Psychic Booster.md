### Description

This circlet, originally designed by lashuntas, fits over the wearer’s brow and wraps around the wearer’s antennae (if any). A _psychic booster_ augments the power of your inherent psychic abilities. If you have telepathy, the range of your telepathy doubles. (For instance, if you have limited telepathy out to a range of 30 feet, the range increases from 30 feet to 60 feet.)
