### DESCRIPTION

This spherical astrolabe’s components are inscrutable while on a planet. However, when not on or directly orbiting a planet, the astrolabe reconfigures itself to guide you toward new cosmic mysteries. By referencing the device, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Piloting checks to navigate to unknown destinations. In addition, by studying the astrolabe for 1 hour and succeeding at a DC 15 Engineering or Mysticism check, you identify a previously uncharted anomaly (such as a strange planet, arcane nebula, or other site of interest) you can then travel to as an unknown destination. The astrolabe can’t be used to identify additional such anomalies until you encounter the currently displayed destination, sating the device’s curiosity.
