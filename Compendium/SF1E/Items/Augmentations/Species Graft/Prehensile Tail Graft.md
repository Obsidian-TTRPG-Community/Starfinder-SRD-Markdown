# Prehensile Tail Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 146_  
**Level**:: 11
**Price**::  24750 
**System**:: Spinal Column  
Maraquoi, huitz’plinas, and others have evolved to be able to use their tails as additional limbs. This augmentation grants you a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects and lets you wield and hold an additional hand’s worth of weapons and equipment. This doesn’t increase the number of attacks you can make during combat.
