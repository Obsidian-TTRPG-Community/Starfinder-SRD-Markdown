## DESCRIPTION

The target's mind is flooded with elder mysteries from the dark between the stars, galaxies, and dimensions. The target must attempt a Will save; on a failure, it begins whispering incoherently and moves half its speed in a random direction. On its turn, it does nothing except whisper incoherently and move half its speed in a random direction. When it moves, the target takes the safest route and doesn't enter hazardous terrain. If the target is attacked, the spell ends immediately.  
Creatures that begin their turn within 20 feet of the target and can hear it whispering must succeed at a Will saving throw or become confused for 1 round. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the whispers until the spell ends.
