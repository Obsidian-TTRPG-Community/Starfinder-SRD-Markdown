## Aeon Stone, Obsidian Annulus

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 110_
**Level**:: 13
**Price**::  55000
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

The first _obsidian annuluses_ appeared as protective devices worn by important Azlanti agents. While this _aeon stone_ orbits you, when you are the target of a spell or spell-like ability, you can spend 1 Resolve point as a reaction to gain spell resistance equal to 11 + half your character level. This spell resistance ends after the effect that triggered your reaction is resolved. The _aeon stone_ can’t provide you spell resistance for 1 hour thereafter, and you can’t gain spell resistance from any _obsidian annulus_ during this time.
