This upgrade consists of chains and barbs that cover your armor. Frequently used by Kuthite warriors to enhance their fearsome appearance, this upgrade also snarls near misses in close combat. When an opponent attacks you with a melee weapon and misses, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to attack rolls when attempting to disarm your opponent of the melee weapon used for that attack until the end of your next turn.
