## Description

You interpose your will between the casting of a spell and the magical energies powering that spell, preventing it from manifesting in this reality. As a reaction when you observe a spell that's 3rd level or lower and being cast within range, you can cast this spell. If you do, you can attempt a dispel check (1d20 + your caster level). The DC equals 11 + the other spellcaster's caster level. If you succeed, the spell fails and has no effect. This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.
