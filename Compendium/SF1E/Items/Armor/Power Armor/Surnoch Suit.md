This sturdy gray suit of powered armor has rows of fine blades running along the body and limbs, which serve as digging claws; it is often used by elite sapper teams to reach entrenched enemies. A surnoch suit grants you a burrow speed. You can tunnel through rock while wearing a surnoch suit, but your speed is reduced to 5 feet.
