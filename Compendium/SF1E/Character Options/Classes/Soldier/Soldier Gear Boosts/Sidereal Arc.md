desc:: You can make a special full attack with a single weapon with the thrown special property. Each attack must be against a different target. When you attack this way, your thrown weapon arcs from each hit target to the next target. For the purposes of determining cover (but not concealment), you’re considered to be attacking from the previous target’s square. At the end of this series of attacks, the weapon returns to you as per the returning fusion.
