### Description

The elite hoverchair caters to the wealthy thrill-seeker, sporting a truly powerful propulsion system on par with that of a jetpack. This hoverchair can hover up to 5 feet above the ground and can hover over liquid surfaces as easily as solid surfaces. By temporarily increasing its usage to 2/round, the hoverchair can move with a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). This model includes three easily accessible compartments that can each store up to 1 bulk worth of items, and it includes three utility gear slots. In addition, the hoverchair includes two armor upgrade slots that can be used only to install weapons with the integrated weapon special property, which the user can operate.
