## DESCRIPTION

You transform your outer layer into solid rock, amplifying your offense and defense. You gain a special unarmed strike that deals lethal damage, doesn’t count as archaic, and threatens squares. You also add 1-1/2 × your character level to damage dealt with this attack (instead of the normal Weapon Specialization damage). You also gain DR 2/—. Finally, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers.
