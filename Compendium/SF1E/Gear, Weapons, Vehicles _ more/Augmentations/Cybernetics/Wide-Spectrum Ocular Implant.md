# WIDE-SPECTRUM OCULAR IMPLANT
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 209_  
**Item Level** 5; **Price** 2,825; **System** Eyes  
These cybernetic spheres replace your eyes entirely. You gain lowlight vision, as well as the ability to see infrared and ultraviolet light. These enhancements grant you a +2 bonus to vision-based Perception checks and allow you to notice some things people who can see only the red-violet light spectrum can’t, including the lasers from darkvision capacitors (see page 209). This doesn’t grant you darkvision, but in darkness you can see significant sources of heat due to your infrared vision.
