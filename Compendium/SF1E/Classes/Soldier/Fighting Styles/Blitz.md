# BLITZ
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 113_  
The blitz fighting style is all about using speed and aggression to get into the thick of melee. You increase your speed and responsiveness, gain abilities that make you better at melee combat than your enemies, and keep on fighting even when surrounded by foes.

## RAPID RESPONSE (EX) - 1ST LEVEL

You gain a +4 bonus to initiative checks and increase your land speed by 10 feet.  

## CHARGE ATTACK (EX) - 5TH LEVEL

As a standard action, you can make a charge without the charge penalties (see page 248), and you can substitute a bull rush for the melee attack at the end of the charge. When you gain the soldier’s onslaught class feature, you can make two attacks instead of one at the end of your charge, both with a –4 penalty.  

## KEEP FIGHTING (EX) - 9TH LEVEL

As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points equal to 2d6 + your soldier level. You can’t use this ability again until after you regain Stamina Points from a 10-minute rest. The number of Stamina Points you regain increases by 1d6 at 10th level, 15th level, and 20th level.  

## PERFECT OPPORTUNITY (EX) - 13TH LEVEL

When you hit a creature with an attack of opportunity, that creature can’t move out of the squares you threaten until the start of its next turn. In addition, when an enemy takes a guarded step (see page 247) out of a square you threaten, you can make an attack of opportunity against it with a –2 penalty to the attack roll. If the target provoked an attack of opportunity by moving, hitting with your attack of opportunity ends the target’s movement immediately, preventing it from carrying out the rest of its movement.  

## AGAINST THE ODDS (EX) - 17TH LEVEL

You gain a bonus to melee damage rolls equal to double the number of enemies within 10 feet of you. Enemies who don’t constitute a significant threat (those with a CR equal to your level – 4 or less, or as determined by the GM) don’t count when calculating this bonus.
