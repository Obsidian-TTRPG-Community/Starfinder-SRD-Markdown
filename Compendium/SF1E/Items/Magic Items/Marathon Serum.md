### Description

A popular substitute for natural talent among less scrupulous athletes, a marathon serum negates the first 5 nonlethal damage you would take from hustling or forced marches performed over the next 12 hours. During this time, the serum also grants you a +2 resistance bonus to Constitution checks made to resist nonlethal damage from extended exertion, and to Fortitude saves made to resist effects that would make you fatigued or exhausted.
