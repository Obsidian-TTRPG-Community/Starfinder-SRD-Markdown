# Solarian Alternate Class Features

## Broken Cycle

**Source**:: Galactic Magic pg. 30
**Class** Solarian

Choose either photon mode or graviton mode. When using stellar mode, you can either become unattuned or enter only the chosen mode. When learning stellar revelations, you can choose only revelations associated with your chosen mode, including learning only the initial zenith revelation: black hole or supernova. You ignore the effect of disproportionate revelations (Core Rulebook 104). Multiply your solarian level by 1-1/2 for the purpose of calculating your insight bonuses to Reflex saves and damage rolls granted by graviton mode and photon mode, respectively.
At 3rd level, you must choose both of the skills for sidereal influence from the list for your chosen mode, and the ability’s effects apply to both skills while sidereal influence lasts. At 11th level, you choose one more skill from that list, and at 19th level, your sidereal influence applies to all five skills associated with your chosen mode. At 9th level, and again at 17th level, you learn two new revelations associated with your chosen mode, at least one of which must be a zenith revelation.
This alters your stellar mode, stellar revelations, sidereal influence, and zenith revelations.

## Electrical Attunement (SU)

**Source**:: Tech Revolution pg. 30
**Class** Solarian

Your solarian powers are tuned to the interplay of energy and resistance, not photons and gravitons. Your stellar mode class feature enables you to be in three modes: energy mode, resistance mode, or unattuned. For the purpose of empowering revelations based on your attunement and meeting prerequisites, treat energy mode as photon mode, and treat resistance mode as graviton mode. Your solarian abilities that deal fire damage or provide cold resistance—such as corona, plasma sheath, or solar flare—deal electricity damage and grant electricity resistance instead. At 1st level, you learn the destructive discharge and energy sink stellar revelations instead of black hole and supernova.
Electromagnetic attunement alters solar manifestation, stellar mode, and stellar revelation.
**Energy Mode:** When you enter energy mode, you gain 1 energy attunement point and become energy-attuned; you’re treated as being photon-attuned for the purpose of determining your stellar revelations’ effects. While energy-attuned, your speeds all increase by 5 feet. This bonus increases by 5 feet for every 3 solarian levels you have.
**Resistance Mode:** When you enter resistance mode, you gain 1 resistance attunement point and become resistance-attuned; you’re treated as being graviton-attuned for the purpose of determining your stellar revelations’ effects. While you’re resistance-attuned, you gain damage reduction 1/—. This bonus increases by 1 for every 6 solarian levels you have, and this damage reduction stacks with one other source of DR.

## Extra Manifestation

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 84_  
**Class** Solarian

You gain a second solar manifestation. You can have only one manifestation active at a time unless you are fully attuned (graviton or photon), in which case you can use two manifestations at once. You must be at least 9th level to select extra manifestations.

Extra manifestation replaces one selection of zenith revelations.

## Stellar Sage

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 30_  
**Class** Solarian

You develop unparalleled mastery of stellar revelations, though doing so comes at the cost of your martial training. You gain a number of skill ranks per level equal to 6 + your Intelligence modifier instead of the normal 4 + your Intelligence modifier. You gain 6 Hit Points and a number of Stamina Points equal to 6 + your Constitution modifier at each level instead of the normal 7 Hit Points and 7 + your Constitution modifier. Your base attack bonus from solarian levels is equal to three-quarters of your class level (equivalent to that of a mystic or technomancer).  
Besides learning additional stellar revelations at every even solarian level, you also learn a bonus stellar revelation at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter.  
At 7th level, as a reaction, whenever you score a critical hit or are critically hit, you can immediately change your stellar mode to any other stellar mode with an equal or lower number of attunement points (such as from photon mode with 3 attunement points to graviton mode with 3 points) after resolving the triggering attack. If you’re unattuned when using this ability, you enter either photon mode or graviton mode with 1 attunement point.  
A solarian’s power stems from a careful balance of cosmic influences, yet some reap power from asymmetry in defiance of conventional study. These practitioners are increasingly common, and although few monasteries actively condemn these heterodoxies, most watch with eager curiosity to see what befalls these enlightened daredevils. At 13th level, you can use any two solarian revelations as a standard action, with one revelation taking effect immediately before the other. Both revelations must be ones you could normally activate with a standard action or move action, and neither can be a zenith revelation. To use this ability, you must spend a number of Resolve Points equal to 3 minus your current number of attunement points (minimum 1 RP). After activating the two revelations, you immediately become unattuned.  
This alters the solarian’s Hit Points, Stamina Points, skill points, base attack bonus, and stellar revelations class features. This replaces flashing strikes and solarian’s onslaught.
