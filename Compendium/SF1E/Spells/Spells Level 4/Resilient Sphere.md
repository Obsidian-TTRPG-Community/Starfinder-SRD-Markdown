## DESCRIPTION

A 10-foot-diameter globe of shimmering force encloses the target creature. The sphere contains the target for the spell’s duration. The sphere functions in the same way as a _wall of force_, except it can be negated by _dispel magic_. A target inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere can’t be physically moved either by creatures outside it or by the struggles of those within.
