# Forcepack (HYBRID)

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 205_  
**Item Level** 9;
**Price**::  13,100  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Light, Heavy; **Bulk** 1  
**Capacity**:: 100; **Usage** 2/round  
A _forcepack_ grants you a fly speed of 60 feet (average maneuverability). You can use this for “cruising flight” at a usage of 1 charge per minute, but you are flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight, or back, is a standard action. A _forcepack_ can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
