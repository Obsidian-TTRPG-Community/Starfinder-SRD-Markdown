# INTERCEPTING EARS
Your eardrums are partially perforated with psychic crystals that resonate at the frequencies commonly used by telepathy. Whenever a creature within 30 feet of you sends or receives a telepathic message using limited telepathy or _telepathic message_, you can overhear the message with a successful DC 25 Perception check (this requires no action). For _mk 2 intercepting ears_ the Perception check DC is 20.
