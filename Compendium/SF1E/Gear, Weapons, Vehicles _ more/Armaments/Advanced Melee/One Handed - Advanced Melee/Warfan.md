### DESCRIPTION

A warfan is a semicircle of nanocarbon fabric with a series of carbonedge ribs spaced evenly in a radial pattern. The ends of these ribs are sharpened such that a proficient wielder can block incoming attacks and make melee strikes with the weapon held in one hand. The flashy movements involved in using a warfan make it a superb weapon for combat when appearances matter as much as damage dealt.
