Effect: A weapon with the _obscuring_ fusion emits mist, smoke, or a similar obscuring vapor when wielded. After attacking with the weapon, as a move action you can cause the weapon to emit enough vapor to conceal you until the start of your next turn. This effect ends immediately if you move for any reason from where you made your attack. This concealment does not interfere with your attacks or benefit others, even if they move into the space you attacked from, and you can’t use it to hide. Conditions such as strong wind or vacuum that quickly disperse vapors negate this concealment. Only projectile weapons or those that deal cold or fire damage can benefit from this fusion.
