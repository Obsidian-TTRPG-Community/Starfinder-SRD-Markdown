# Fast Healing (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 153_, _Alien Archive 3 pg. 151_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 150_, _Alien Archive pg. 154_  
The creature regains the listed number of Hit Points at the start of its turn. Unless otherwise noted, the creature can never exceed its maximum Hit Points.  
Fast healing doesnâ€™t restore Hit Points lost from starvation, thirst, or suffocation, nor does it allow a creature to regrow or reattach lost body parts, unless otherwise stated. Fast healing continues to function until a creature dies, at which point the effects of fast healing end immediately.

_Format_: **Defensive Abilities** fast healing 5.
