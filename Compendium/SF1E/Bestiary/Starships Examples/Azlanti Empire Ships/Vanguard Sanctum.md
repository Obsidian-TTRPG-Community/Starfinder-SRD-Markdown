## DESCRIPTION

Vanguard Craftworks custom builds its Sanctum model to provide mobile residences for wealthy Azlanti who require opulence during interplanetary transit. A Sanctum provides spacious quarters and sweeping views, along with every amenity a discerning passenger could want. Life boats on this vessel are for the passengers, since the crew is assumed to be committed to the ship.  
  
**Customization**: Vanguard Sanctums can vary widely, since each user customizes the ship to personal taste. A magicusing noble might own the one in the stat block, acting as the captain, serving as gunner on aeon casters, and using both guest quarters as one stately apartment.  
  
**Star Palaces**: Vanguard and other companies build even bigger luxury vessels, so-called star palaces, for wealthy and noble customers. Absent special dispensation, imperial law limits commoners to bulk freighter frames for such extravagant personal starships. Aristocrats can use cruiser frames, allowing for larger crew (or servant) complements and heavier weapons. However, even nobles need permission to build more sizable and militarily capable starships. The Ixomander twins who rule from the Aeon Throne continue the tradition of awarding the right to build capital ships only to noble families of proven loyalty.
