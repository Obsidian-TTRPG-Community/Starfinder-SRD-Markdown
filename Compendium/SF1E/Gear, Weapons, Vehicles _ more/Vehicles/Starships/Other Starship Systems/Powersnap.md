# POWERSNAP
**PCU** 0; **Cost (in BP)** 3 × size category  
A starship with the powersap system can siphon power from enemy starships it hits with a melee weapon. Once per starship combat, when a starship with a powersap system hits an enemy starship with a melee weapon (page 12), at the start of the next engineering phase, the starship with the powersap system is affected as if an engineer had used the divert action to divert power to a randomly chosen system (roll 1d4; 1 = engines; 2 = science equipment; 3 = weapons; 4 = shields). Additionally, the enemy starship gains a critical damage condition as if the attack had dealt damage exceeding the starship’s Critical Threshold.
