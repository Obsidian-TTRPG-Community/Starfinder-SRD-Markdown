Among okantan tribes, the runebreaker is a legendary warrior of great magical promise trained not to hone that magic art, but to contain it within to gird herself against the sorcery of the clan’s enemies. Okanta runebreakers swear solemn vows to defend their kin against any and all magical incursions and refuse to leave Orbis Aurea unless the threat to their clan originates from off-world. Each runebreaker forsakes their name to take on a title or mantle passed down by other runebreakers of their clan.
