## DESCRIPTION

You tweak a creature's genetic code, altering its environmental adaptations to better suit the surrounding climate. For the duration, the target reduces the severity of dangerous temperatures by one step. For example, cold is reduced to comfortable, while extreme heat is reduced to severe heat. _Climate adaptation_ can protect the target from either cold or heat but not both simultaneously.
