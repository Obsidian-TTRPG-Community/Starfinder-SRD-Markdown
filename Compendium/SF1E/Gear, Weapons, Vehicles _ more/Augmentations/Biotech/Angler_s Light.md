# ANGLER'S LIGHT
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 83_  
**Item Level** 2; **Price** 560; **System** Spinal Column  
This enhancement adds an antenna-like bioluminescent pod of photobacteria that extends from the top of the spinal column to provide light. Its original purpose was for asteroid miners who needed both hands for hefty equipment, but it has also grown popular among rave communities. An angler’s light increases the light level from darkness to dim light, or from dim light to normal light, either in a 20-foot cone or a 10-foot radius; altering the shape of the light’s illumination is a move action. The effects of multiple angler’s lights do not stack.
