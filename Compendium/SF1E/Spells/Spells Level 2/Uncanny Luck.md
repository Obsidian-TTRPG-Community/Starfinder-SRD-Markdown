## Description

Mimicking the luck of halflings, you presciently react or tug on the strands of fate, casting this spell just after a d20 roll you attempt for a saving throw or an enemy attempts for an attack against you. The triggering roll must be rerolled, unless it's an attack roll made by an enemy who saves or whose spell resistance you fail to overcome.
