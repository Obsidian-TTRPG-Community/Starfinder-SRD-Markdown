## Aeon Stone, Kehtarite Oval

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 69_
**Level**:: 5
**Price**::  3000
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

Although found on other worlds, the brittle blue mineral kehtarite is named after and is especially prevalent on Kehtaria, where it’s often incorporated into fire-suppressing insulation. While this aeon stone orbits you, it inhibits nearby combustion. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the burning condition, and you automatically extinguish any nonmagical fires in your space or any squares you enter, to a maximum of 20 5-foot cubes per minute. When any burst or emanation that deals fire damage or has the fire descriptor (such as an incendiary grenade or explosive blast) is centered on a space or intersection within your reach, as a reaction, you can drain the aeon stone’s magic and attempt a Reflex save against the effect’s save DC (or DC 13 plus half the effect’s item level or CR if it doesn’t have a saving throw) to suppress the effect. If you succeed, you delay the effect for 1 round, after which it takes effect as normal. When drained in this way, the aeon stone provides no further benefits for 24 hours.
