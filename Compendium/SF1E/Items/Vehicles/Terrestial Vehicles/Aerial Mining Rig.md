### Special Abilities

**Mining Grav Laser (Ex)** This heavy weapon has a range increment of 240 feet. When an attack with a mining grav laser hits, it ignores 18 points of hardness and pulls the target a number of feet toward the rig equal to the damage dealt; a pulled creature lands prone. A creature struck can halve the distance pulled and negate falling prone with a successful Reflex saving throw. If the target is a vehicle, its pilot can halve this distance with a successful Piloting check.

### Description

An aerial mining rig has two upper levels that are partially open to the elements and two lower levels that hold much of its ore-collecting and processing machinery, as well as the controls for its mining grav laser.
