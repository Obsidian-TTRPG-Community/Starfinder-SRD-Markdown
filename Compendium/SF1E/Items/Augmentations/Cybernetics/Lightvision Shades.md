# Lightvision Shades

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 58_, _Starfinder Soldiers of Brass pg. 45_  
**Level**:: 2
**Price**::  500 
**System**:: Eyes  
This augmentation is a pair of sunglasses (your choice of style when you purchase them) that are integrated into your head. You can extend or retract these lenses as a swift action. While you have the lightvision shades active, you perceive bright light as though it were normal light, and you perceive areas of normal light as though they were dim light. In addition, while the shades are active, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against effects that inflict the blinded or dazzled condition.
