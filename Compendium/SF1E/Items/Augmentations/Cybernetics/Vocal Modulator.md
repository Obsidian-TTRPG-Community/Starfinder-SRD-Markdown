# Vocal Modulator

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 209_  
**Level**:: 1
**Price**::  125 
**System**:: Throat  
A vocal modulator includes a series of miniature actuators built specifically to reshape your voice box, along with miniature hyper-resonant chambers that dynamically close or open. This allows you to change the pitch, timbre, and tone of your voice. You can more easily imitate accents or pronounce alien languages. When using Disguise to change your appearance, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus if the change in your voice also helps your disguise (at the GM’s discretion).
