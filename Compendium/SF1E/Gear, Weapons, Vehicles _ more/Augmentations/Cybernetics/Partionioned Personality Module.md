# PARTIONIONED PERSONALITY MODULE
**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 87_  
**Item Level** 7; **Price** 6,800; **System** Eyes  
Initially developed as a device to closely monitor organic cerebral activity, these neural implants study the brain activity of the host and then design an artificial copy of their thought patterns, decision trees, and emotional profile. This artificial personality serves as a backup for the host that bolsters their mental faculties and can be activated when psychic attacks disrupt their free will. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saves against charm, compulsion, or mind-affecting effects. Once per day when you fail a save against a charm, compulsion, or mind-affecting effect, you can activate your backup personality by spending a Resolve Point to immediately reroll the save and take the new result.
