# Aurora Cannon

The aurora cannon is a variant plasma cannon with holding chambers that overcharge the plasma generated within the weapon. The walls of these chambers are typically translucent, allowing a veiled view of the shifting plasma. The aurora cannonâ€™s modified plasma blasts cause creatures it hits to glow with a surprisingly beautiful aura, making it difficult for them to hide. Aurora cannons are categorized according to the primary composition of these auroras, from the hydrogen aurora cannon to the electron and proton models.

### Plasma Weapons

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
