# ESHAR - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 144_  
Eshars are hulking, serpentine beasts from the expansive, sandy deserts of the tidally locked planet Verces. They are used for battle, transportation, and even for sport, in an elaborate zone-capturing game that can last for days.

**Senses** blindsight (vibration) 60 ft., low-light vision

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Lie in Wait (Ex)** While mounted on your eshar companion, you can remain burrowed in sand or loose dirt for up to 1 hour, and if combat begins during this time, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to any skill check (normally Perception or Stealth) to determine whether you act in a surprise round.

**Screech (Ex)** As a standard action, an eshar can unleash a terrifying screech, causing each creature within 30 feet to become shaken for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the eshar’s level). Regardless of whether a creature succeeds at this check, it is immune to that eshar’s screech for 24 hours. Eshars are immune to the screech ability of other eshars, and you are immune to the screech of your own eshar companion.
