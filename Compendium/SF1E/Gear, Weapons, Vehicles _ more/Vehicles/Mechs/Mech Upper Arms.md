# MECH UPPER ARMS
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 101_  
A mech's upper limbs typically represent a pair of arms, though they can be found in other forms, such as multiple limbs or even mechanical tentacles. A mech is limited to a single set of upper limbs. Upper limbs modify a variety of the mech's statistics and may provide additional uses for Power Points.

Some upper limbs have attack modifiers marked with an asterisk (\*). Choose either the melee or ranged attack modifier and increase it by 1 when you purchase these upper limbs.
