## DESCRIPTION

You make a melee attack against a single target’s EAC, adding your key ability score modifier to the attack roll instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be fatigued for the spell’s duration. This spell has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued. Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
