# ARCANE SIGHT

## DESCRIPTION

This spell allows you to see magic sources within 120 feet of you. The effect is similar to that of a detect magic spell, but arcane sight does not require concentration and discerns information more quickly.

You know the location and caster level of all magic sources within your sight. If the magic sources are in line of sight, you can attempt a DC 28 Mysticism check (one check per source) to determine the school of magic involved in each source.

If you concentrate on a specific creature within 120 feet of you as a standard action, you can determine whether it has any spellcasting or spell-like abilities and the caster level of the most powerful spell or spell-like ability the creature currently has available for use.

You can attempt a Mysticism skill check to identify the properties of magic or hybrid items (but not artifacts), as if you were using _identify_.
