# Creature Compansions

Regardless of the way you gain a creature companion, granting your companion additional actions requires the Creature Companion Adept feat. You can become progressively better at working with your creature companion by taking subsequent creature companion feats.

You can use the creature companion feats listed here only with a creature companion whose level is no greater than your ranks in Survival.
