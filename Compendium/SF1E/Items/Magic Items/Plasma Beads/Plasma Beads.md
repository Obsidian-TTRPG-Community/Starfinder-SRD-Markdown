These four spherical beads strung with a cord emit a slight fiery glow from the plasma magically sealed inside them. While you wear the necklace, as a standard action, you can detach a bead and throw it (range increment 20 feet) as a ranged attack targeting a grid intersection (AC 5). If you throw the bead through a narrow opening, your attack roll must equal or exceed the opening’s AC (10 for a narrow opening or 15 for an extremely narrow one) to avoid hitting the side and detonating the bead prematurely. When the bead strikes a hard surface, it explodes in a 20-foot radius, dealing electricity and fire damage according to its type, as shown on the table below. A target that succeeds at a Reflex save (see the table) takes only half damage. Once you detach a bead, it loses its magic if it hasn’t exploded after 5 rounds. If the necklace isn’t worn, detached beads immediately become nonmagical.
