# VEHICLES

Vehicles range from simple personal transports to massive airships and sea vessels. The rules for vehicles and vehicle chases are found in Chapter 8, starting on page 278. Starships are handled differently from vehicles—see Chapter 9 for more on starships. Statistics for specific vehicles are detailed below.

A vehicle stat block contains the following entries.

-   **Name and Level**: These list the vehicle’s name and item level.
-   **Price**: This entry lists the vehicle’s price in credits. The availability of some vehicles might be restricted, and a player must ask the GM what is available for purchase.
-   **Size and Vehicle Type**: This entry lists the vehicle’s size and whether the vehicle is built for land, water, atmospheric flight, or a combination thereof, followed by its dimensions.
-   **Speed**: The speed entry first lists the vehicle’s drive speed, followed by its full speed, and concludes with its speed in miles per hour for overland movement over the terrain type for which the vehicle was designed. If the speed entry doesn’t list a movement type, the vehicle can move only on the ground. If the speed entry lists only swim, the vehicle must move underwater, and if the speed entry lists only fly, the vehicle must fly (though most flying vehicles can also move on the ground). Some vehicles have hover speeds, which means they can move overland and over water but not underwater.
-   **EAC and KAC**: These entries indicate the Energy Armor Class and Kinetic Armor Class for the vehicle.
-   **Cover**: This entry indicates the type of cover the vehicle gives its pilot and passengers. This might vary based on circumstances—a passenger hanging out of a window to fire a weapon doesn’t get the full benefit of the vehicle’s cover.
-   **HP**: This entry lists the vehicle’s Hit Points. If the vehicle is reduced to or below the number of HP listed in parentheses, it’s broken. While broken, the vehicle takes a –2 penalty to its AC and collision DC, its Piloting modifier decreases by 2, and its full speed and mph speed are halved. If a vehicle is reduced to 0 HP, it’s wrecked. A wrecked vehicle can’t be piloted, and it might be difficult or impossible to repair. If the vehicle is in water when it is wrecked, it sinks; if it is flying, it falls.
-   **Hardness**: As an object, a vehicle has hardness (see page 409). Any damage a vehicle takes is reduced by its hardness.
-   **Attack**: This entry indicates an attack the vehicle has, the damage it deals, and the DC to avoid it (if any). Most vehicles have only collision attacks, which deal bludgeoning damage. (See Vehicle Collision Damage on page 229 and the ram and the run over action on page 279 for more on collisions.)
-   **Modifiers**: The vehicle imposes these modifiers on the attack rolls and listed skill checks of its pilot and passengers. The attack roll penalty worsens at full speed, as indicated in parentheses.
-   **Systems**: The vehicle’s special systems, such as autocontrol (see page 280), autopilot (see page 280), or comm units (see page 218), are listed here, if it has any.
-   **Passengers**: If the vehicle can carry extra passengers, this entry lists how many the vehicle can hold in addition to the pilot.
-   **Special Abilities**: Any abilities unique to the vehicle are described in full at the end of the stat block.

# UPGRADING VEHICLES
Sometimes an owner’s own level outpaces their trusty vehicle’s capabilities, and when modifications (pages 80–83) aren’t enough, it’s time for a retrofit that boosts the vehicle’s item level. This often increases the vehicle’s performance and defenses, providing a good way for PCs to keep their vehicle competitive in tactical combat and vehicle chases without having to build or buy a completely new vehicle. The process for upgrading a vehicle varies, depending on whether the vehicle is a custom creation using the rules presented earlier in this chapter, or whether the vehicle is a prebuilt vehicle, such as those found on pages 228–229 of the Core Rulebook. In either case, upgrading a vehicle by one level takes a number of days based on the vehicle’s size: Medium = 1 day, Large = 2 days, Huge = 3 days, Gargantuan = 5 days, and Colossal = 10 days.  
**Custom Vehicles:** Calculate the price of the custom vehicle as though its item level were one higher (plus any grafts you want to add as part of the upgrade). The cost of upgrading the vehicle equals the difference between this higher price and the vehicle’s current price. Upon completing the upgrade, recalculate the vehicle’s statistics using the new item level (plus any added grafts).  
**Prebuilt Vehicles:** Upgrading a prebuilt vehicle costs a number of credits equal to 50% of the vehicle’s current cost. The vehicle’s item level increases by 1, and its new price becomes the sum of its original price plus the cost of any subsequent upgrades. The vehicle’s EAC and KAC values each increase by 1; if the vehicle’s new level is divisible by 5, the EAC and KAC instead increase by 2 each.  
The vehicle gains additional Hit Points based on its new level. Increase the Hit Points by 10 if the vehicle’s new level is 4 or lower, by 15 if the new level is between 5–10, by 20 if the new level is between 11–15, or by 30 if the new level is 16 or higher. If the vehicle’s new level is 6 or higher, increase its hardness by 1. If the vehicle’s new level is divisible by 4, increase its speed by 5 feet, increase its full speed by 50 feet, and increase its overland speed by 20%.  
If the vehicle’s new level is divisible by 5, the vehicle gains an additional modification slot. As part of performing the upgrade, a PC can also remove or install any available vehicle modifications without increasing the total time required for the upgrade.

# VEHICLE ENCOUNTERS
High-speed vehicle chases have long been a staple of cinematic action, and Starfinder brings this adrenaline-pumping tension to your game using the vehicle tactical and chase rules (Core Rulebook 278–286). Even then, there are a few considerations when introducing vehicles into your campaign to maximize these encounters’ excitement and fun while also avoiding a few potential pitfalls.  

## VEHICLES IN TACTICAL COMBAT

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 88_  
Whether your PCs are facing off against space goblins driving junk dune buggies on Akiton or cybernetic ninjas riding enercycles on the streets of Verces, adding vehicles to a tactical encounter gives another dimension to the action. Vehicles provide secondary targets for the PCs to attack or defend against, such as goblins’ scrapheap ATVs the PCs have to wreck before they can crash into the PCs’ own vehicles and explode. Even more crucially, vehicles represent a big change to speed and action economy, with one creature piloting a vehicle while all of the passengers benefit from the free movement around the battlefield. Vehicles might even be a crucial tool in accessing an environment, such as a hovercar that enables the PCs to chase enemies escaping over the waves.  

### CHOOSING THE RIGHT VEHICLE

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 88_  
The vehicles you choose strongly determine an encounter’s feel. An skirmish with goblins in dune buggies is very different than those same goblins driving through the desert on a huge, heavily armored transport scavenging scrap metal.  
Is the tactical combat likely to evolve into a chase, or is it the conclusion of a chase? If either is true, choose vehicles with capabilities similar to your PCs’ vehicles. Evenly matched vehicles keep the tension high, as both parties stand a fair chance of victory. Using a vehicle with a slightly different movement form (wheeled travel compared to hover-based movement, for example) can help you create specific zones to give your PCs the advantage or disadvantage, depending on your needs.  
How much cover does the vehicle provide? When a vehicle provides improved cover or total cover, its passengers usually become so difficult to harm that the vehicle itself becomes the only viable target. However, if your NPCs are of lower CR, the massive cover benefits might increase their defenses to competitive levels that keep them in the fight for a few additional rounds. Compare this to a vehicle that provides cover, partial cover, or no cover, which leaves the passengers exposed and invites gunfire between rival crews.  
If you don’t see the perfect vehicle in an official resource, try using the vehicle creation rules in this book (page 76) to make your own vehicle for the encounter.  

### POWER LEVEL

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 88_  
Technically, a vehicle doesn’t have a Challenge Rating, and it’s not part of an NPC’s typical gear allowance. So how does one account for a vehicle when building and balancing an encounter? There’s no magical formula, but there are important qualitative considerations. A vehicle might simply grant a creature more mobility without significantly increasing their power, such as how ysoki on motorcycles don’t have greater firepower or defenses, in which case no adjustment is needed. A vehicle that provides substantial cover, passenger space, or mobility options might significantly change the encounter, though, allowing gunners to fire freely from untouchable heights or behind durable barriers. A vehicle might even have potent integrated weapons that could exceed the passengers’ usual gear allotments. In these cases, consider increasing the CR by 1, much as recommended on page 389 of the Core Rulebook.  
Don’t overlook the impact vehicles can have on the PCs’ resources. A powerful vehicle might make a fun challenge, but it could also represent a huge boost to wealth if captured. In some cases, stealing such a tank is the encounter’s goal, yet it could easily upset the balance of subsequent encounters. Lower-level vehicles, on the other hand, are unlikely to upset wealth and encounter balance, even if sold.  

## CHASE COMBAT

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 88_  
Many of the same considerations of vehicle choice and power levels apply to designing chase encounters, with key differences.  

### TERRAIN AND OBSTACLES

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 88_  
Because vehicle chases are more abstract than tactical combat, you have the freedom to create and describe any environment you need without depicting it on a map, giving you substantial flexibility. Consider your chase zones’ features and how these might facilitate or complicate maneuvers. An area with lots of small obstacles like rocks, trashcans, or pedestrians might increase the DC of Keep Pace or Speed Up actions. An area with slippery mud or wet pavement might increase the DC of Evade and Slow Down actions. Varying these conditions keeps each zone exciting, especially if those conditions might affect certain vehicles unequally. Shallow pools of acid can melt the tires off a vehicle, but a hover vehicle likely avoids this damage altogether. Smoke-filled air might endanger occupants of a vehicle that doesn’t provide passengers with total cover. The ratio of how many hazards threaten the PCs versus their opponents can tip the encounter’s overall challenge in either side’s favor.  
A basic chase is strictly linear, but environments are rarely so simple. Upon departing a zone, a vehicle might have to choose between multiple routes that later intersect and rejoin, providing the participants vital options that enhance engagement. Do the PCs veer onto the highway where their exposed position offsets their ability to speed up, or do they detour into the crowded alleys where they enjoy cover yet must avoid more obstacles? When presenting these choices, be sure the players have enough context to infer how they will impact the experience, otherwise their actions might feel random and unfulfilling.  

### PACING

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 89_  
Because escaping and getting left behind (Core Rulebook 284) are relatively easy in Starfinder, requiring only a two-zone difference, it’s valuable to plan for ways to extend an important chase scene near the encounter’s start and help the PCs succeed near the end. This ensures that the chase doesn’t end prematurely and uneventfully, and it allows the PCs to experience the different environments you’ve created for them.  
Extending a chase scene is more art than science, especially since bad die rolls could stymie even the best drivers. If one party is too far ahead, adding complications could slow them down, and removing earlier complications for whichever group is behind could speed them up. Be careful of using too much overt manipulation, however, as a heavy hand can dispel the idea that the chase was ever fair.
