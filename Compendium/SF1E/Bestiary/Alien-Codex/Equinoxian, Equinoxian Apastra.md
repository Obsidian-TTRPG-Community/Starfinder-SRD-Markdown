# Equinoxian, Equinoxian Apastra

Equinoxians are rare and unusual native outsiders who simultaneously embody the power of both black holes and blazing suns. Alternating waves of photons and gravitons constantly travel along their roughly humanoid‑shaped bodies. An equinoxian’s head and legs might shine with light while its torso and arms remain as black as the void, and a few seconds later, the opposite may be true, as waves of energy ripple through the equinoxian’s body. As equinoxians age and their connection to the Cycle grows, they must learn to master the perfect balance of the contradictory powers within themselves, lest they lose control of those forces.

Equinoxian periastras are masters of the Cycle, perpetually balancing the gravitonic and photonic forces comprising their bodies, and they are legendary for their fighting prowess. They oppose forces of chaos and guard sites holy to solarians, allowing visitors to enter only after they have proven their mastery of the Cycle in combat.

Those equinoxians who cannot maintain balance are driven mad, becoming the tragic and powerful figures known as apastras. Apastras seek to cause imbalance and collapse wherever they can, and solarians justly fear the enraged creatures.

### Special Abilities

**Flashing Strikes (Ex)** This functions as the flashing strikes solarian class feature.

**Perfect Alignment (Su)** An apastra is always both fully graviton attuned and fully photon attuned.

**Solar Manifestation (Su)** This functions as the solar manifestation solarian class feature.

**Solar Storm (Su)** Once a day, an apastra can give in to the gravitonic and photonic forces that rage within it, expelling this energy in a cataclysmic storm. The solar storm has a range of 60 feet and a 15-foot radius. Creatures that enter the storm or that begin their turns in it take 8d6 fire damage (Fortitude DC 21 half) and must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or be hurled 1d6×10 feet in a random direction and fall prone (creatures that hit a wall or other barrier take no additional damage). The storm is difficult terrain and obscures all sight beyond 5 feet. Creatures within 5 feet of an attacker while in the storm have concealment. When the apastra uses solar storm, it can maintain the storm for up to an additional 1d3 rounds. An apastra must take a full action each round to maintain the storm, and it can move the storm up to 30 feet as part of that full action. An apastra is immune to the effects of its own or any other apastra’s solar storm.

**Solarian’s Onslaught (Ex)** This functions as the solarian’s onslaught solarian class feature.

**Stellar Revelations (Su)** An apastra can use the black hole and supernova solarian stellar revelations. It can use either stellar revelation once before that revelation needs to recharge. Once it has used each stellar revelation once, they both recharge in 1d4 rounds.

**Throw Solar Weapon (Ex)** An apastra can throw its solar weapon at a foe as a ranged attack with a 40-foot range increment. This does not cause the weapon to be dismissed. An apastra’s thrown solar weapon returns to its hand just before its next turn.
