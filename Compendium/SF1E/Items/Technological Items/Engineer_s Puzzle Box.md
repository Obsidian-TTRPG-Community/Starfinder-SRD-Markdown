### Description

This small box is covered with various circuits, electronic locks, gears, and other mechanisms that you must unlock or bypass in order to reach the box’s hollow center. The mechanisms shift and rearrange automatically, allowing for a multitude of combinations to keep the box from opening. Once unlocked, the box resets itself and reorders the mechanisms, starting the process over. Using an engineer’s puzzle box to improve your skills requires 1 hour and a DC 25 Engineering check. If you succeed at the check, you reduce the time required to disable devices using the Engineering skill by 2 rounds (to a minimum of 1 round). This bonus lasts for 24 hours. You can benefit from only one engineer’s puzzle box at a time.  
  
Some engineering organizations and mechanics’ societies are known to put prizes or certificates in the center of an engineer’s puzzle box as a final test for applicants.
