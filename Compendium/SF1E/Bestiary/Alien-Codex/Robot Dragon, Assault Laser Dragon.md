### Special Abilities

**Laser Bolt (Ex)** A laser dragon can fire laser beams from their mouth, eyes, or wingtips. This attack has a range increment of 100 feet, targets EAC, and has the burn critical hit effect that lists a number of d6s equal to one quarter their level (minimum 1). The attack also has the sniper weapon special property with a range of 1,000 feet.  
**Robotic (Ex)** For effects targeting creatures by type, laser dragons count as both dragons and constructs (whichever allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one of those types, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). They receive a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, and poison unless those effects specifically target constructs. Additionally, they are protected from environmental effects as if wearing armor (of an item level equal to the dragon’s CR) with its environmental protection active.

## Description

Robot dragons are incredibly complex artificial constructs so advanced they attract a dragon’s soul upon completion, much like android bodies. Each is built around a specific category of weapon. The creation of such creatures is a nearly lost art, and while robot dragons are often built as weapons of war to serve specific groups, they inevitably become independent.
