# CAVATINA'S SQUEEZEBOX
**Source** _Ports of Call pg. 63_  
**Level** 5; **Price** 2800  
**Capacity** 20; **Usage** 1/round  
**Hands** 2; **Bulk** 1

### DESCRIPTION
Crafted by the members of the Besmaran priesthood at the Museum of Space Creatures, this electronic concertina emits sounds similar to an omaâ€™s calming cry when played as a move action. If you succeed at a DC 17 Profession (musician) check when you play the squeezebox, you and all allies within 60 feet who can hear the music gain a +1 morale bonus to saving throws against fear effects until the beginning of your next turn. You can continue to play the squeezebox and grant this bonus as a move action each subsequent round without needing to attempt the skill check again. However, if you stop playing for even 1 round, you must succeed at the skill check again to grant the bonus again. This is a sense-dependent effect.|
