## DESCRIPTION

This spell causes living creatures in the area to fall into a magical sleep, gaining the asleep condition (except normal noise doesn’t wake up the sleeping creatures). Creatures with the lowest CR are affected first. Among creatures of equal CR, those who are closest to the spell’s point of origin are affected first. _Deep slumber_ doesn’t affect unconscious creatures, constructs, or undead creatures.
