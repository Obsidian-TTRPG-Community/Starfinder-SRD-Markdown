# Agathion, Claustral

Agathions, who have humanoid forms with animal aspects, form from the souls of mortals who reached an enlightened state and became infused with holy power. Most remain content to meditate and explore their home plane of Nirvana, but many others visit the Material Plane to combat evil, especially evil that threatens the natural world.

Four-armed and four-eyed vicunals resemble ruthigs and share ruthigs’ preference for traveling in groups. This variation of herd mentality makes vicunals intuitive therapists who tirelessly attend to their companions’ physical and emotional injuries. Despite their tenacity and indefatigable skirmishing tactics, these agathions struggle to overcome powerful foes. In these cases, vicunals typically recruit mortal agents willing to and capable of neutralizing the evil.

Maned claustrals resemble the predatory eohis of the Nejeor system, expressing much of eohis’ love of pursuing and hounding their targets. However, claustrals almost never hunt to kill, instead patrolling cityscapes to protect their adopted fauna or neutralize deadly beasts. Although they take pains to warn negligent urbanites who inadvertently harm animals, claustrals often respond with violence to subdue or even kill serial abusers, such as those who run beast-fighting circuits. To claustrals’ chagrin, these brief rampages can spur rumors of an escaped beast, attracting bounty hunters who hope to slay the mysterious creature.

### Special Abilities

**Conservation Aura (Su)** A claustral’s aura preserves imperiled natural creatures. Creatures with the animal or plant type within this aura gain fast healing 2. This fast healing doubles for affected creatures that are below half their maximum Hit Points or that are in an urban environment. If an affected creature would be reduced to 0 Hit Points by an effect the claustral can see, the claustral can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to reduce the damage dealt to that creature by the effect by 6d6. A claustral can suppress the aura’s effects for any number of those animals and plants as a free action.  
**Preserver’s Patience (Ex)** A claustral can choose to deal nonlethal damage with any of its attacks against animals and plants without taking a penalty. A claustral gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls to resolve grapple and trip combat maneuvers, and this bonus doubles against animals and plants.  
**Speak with Animals (Su)** A claustral can communicate with animals and use language-dependent effects on them.
