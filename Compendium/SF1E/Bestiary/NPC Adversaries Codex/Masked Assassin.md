# MASKED ASSASSIN
Assassins are skilled killers who excel in eliminating single targets. Often using various forms of stealth and subterfuge, they can pass between guards undetected and skillfully navigate traps to quickly dispatch their marked query. High-profile corporations, cults, or criminal syndicates may employ assassins, but most work alone or as part of secretive guilds for hire and by contract.  
Assassins work in the shadows, with some operating discreetly among the underbellies of society and others conducting their business while hiding in plain sight. Regardless of their methods, they’re valued for their ability to hide their tracks and maintain their employer’s anonymity. The most skilled assassins can take out high-profile figures without leaving any evidence for investigators to follow. The more difficult the job and the greater the prominence of the target, the higher the fee they command.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Masked Aspect (Ex)** Twice per day, when a masked assassin dons a mask or other full-face covering, they can instantaneously take on the appearance of any creature they’ve seen in person within the past 24 hours. A creature must succeed at a Perception check to realize this is a disguise (DC = 20 + 1.5 × the masked assassin’s CR). This effect lasts for 10 minutes or until the effect is ended.

## DESCRIPTION

Masked assassins use masks to skillfully disguise their appearance. They can change their entire aspect in the blink of an eye, making it easy to approach their targets unnoticed and escape into the crowd after eliminating the target. Masked assassins rely primarily on their ability to work in plain sight, and are most likely to be encountered by guards and hired hands while hunting. They’re typically hired to assassinate lower-value targets. If discovered, they typically flee rather than fight and risk capture or death.
