## DESCRIPTION

The Sovereign Monitor is a long-range imperial patrol ship that polices the empire’s borders or serves as an escort for larger vessels. The Monitor’s powerful sensors can track other spacecraft effectively at maximum range, and its gravity gun allows it to capture ships or objects for closer inspection. Other systems ensure Azlanti technology never falls into enemy hands—a particularly important consideration in this case, given that these ships are often on the empire’s fringes and thus most vulnerable to attack or capture by outsiders.
