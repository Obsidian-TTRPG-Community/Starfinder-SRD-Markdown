ABOUT

**Boon** Convoy drivers can arrange for PCs to travel with a convoy to a destination of their choice, either as guests or as guards.

Convoy drivers are sturdy veterans with an eye for troublemakers. They are armed and skilled at driving and protecting laden trucks, hovercraft, or similar vehicles, or in low-tech fringe areas they ride horses and lead wagons safely through dangerous territory.

If encountered in a city or town, convoy drivers serve as city guards or patrol officers, either on foot or on vehicles, dedicated to keeping the peace and maintaining order. They favor disarming, tripping, sundering, and dealing nonlethal damage when possible to break up fights and quell the unruly. They can offer a different boon to characters befriending them.
