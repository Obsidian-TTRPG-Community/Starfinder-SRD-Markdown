# ADAPTIVE ENERGY SHIELD

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 80_  
**Item Level** 10; **Price** 17,500  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Any; **Bulk** —  
This intelligent polymer weave covers the entire armor. When in an unattuned state, the first time you take energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic), the adaptive mesh transforms to better withstand attacks of the same type; your armor thereafter grants you energy resistance 5 against that energy type. The energy resistance does not apply to the initial attack. The armor remains attuned to that energy type (even if you take other forms of energy damage) until it has taken no damage of the attuned type for 5 minutes. It then becomes unattuned.
