As a standard action, you can deploy a fire extinguisher to end a burn effect on any one creature or object of Medium or smaller size. Extinguishing a Large creature or object takes 2 rounds, and the number of rounds required doubles with each size category beyond Large. A fire extinguisher can function for 20 rounds (which need not be consecutive) and can be recharged for 10% of the purchase price.
