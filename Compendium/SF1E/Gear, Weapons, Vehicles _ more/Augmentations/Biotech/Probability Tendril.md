# PROBABILITY TENDRIL
One of your hands is replaced by a lab-grown protean tendril that allows you to replicate a protean’s chaotic powers. As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to target a creature within 30 feet and force it to succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) or be affected by a random effect from the table below.  
You can choose not to spend a Resolve Point before you use this ability, but doing so requires you to succeed at the same save or be subject to the same effect. The augmentation’s model determines which die you roll on the following table to determine the random effect.


| D10 | EFFECT                                                                                                                          |

| 9   | Target is affected by baleful polymorph (level 6); its polymorphed form is random                                               |
| 10  | Target’s head is wracked with pain, dealing 18d6 damage (half on a successful save)                                             |
