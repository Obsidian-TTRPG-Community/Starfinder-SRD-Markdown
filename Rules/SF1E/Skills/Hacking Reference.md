# HACKING REFERENCE
> [!attention] HACK SYSTEM
> **Source** [_Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 139_](https://paizo.com/products/btpy9ssr?Starfinder-Core-Rulebook)  
> You can use Computers to hack a computer system to which you don’t already have access. Hacking a computer system typically takes one full action per tier of the computer system. You can cut this time in half (to a minimum of one full action) for every 5 by which you increase the DC of the Computers check. If you succeed at the check, you gain access to any part of the computer that is not behind a firewall (see page 217). This allows you to use the basic functions of the computer and to make further checks that require you to have access. Accessing parts of a computer behind a firewall requires an additional Computers check for each firewall.
## Access Unsecured System (p. 138)

This is the only Computers check that can be performed untrained

|Trained Skill DC|Untrained Skill DC|
|---|---|
|10|Take 20|

## Hack System (p. 138, 139, 214)

If you Take 20 before disabling countermeasures, they automatically activate

|Tier|DC to Hack (1)|DC for Root Access (2)|Full Actions to Hack (3)|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|17|37|1|
|2|21|41|2|
|3|25|45|3|
|4|29|49|4|
|5|33|53|5|
|6|37|57|6|
|7|41|61|7|
|8|45|65|8|
|9|49|69|9|
|10|53|73|10|

**1** Physical access to the user interface is required to hack a computer unless using a specialized tool

**2** Gaining root access requires already having access and not all computers can be hacked for root access

**3** The number of full actions required to hack or gain root access can be reduced by half (to a minimum of one full action) for every 5 you increase the DC of the check

## Disable or Manipulate Module (p. 139)

You cannot Take 20 on any of these checks

|Tier|DC without Root Access|DC with Root Access|Time to Disable/Manipulate|Time to Add/Remove|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|17|10|1 standard action|1 minute|
|2|21|10|1 standard action|2 minutes|
|3|25|10|1 standard action|3 minutes|
|4|29|10|1 standard action|4 minutes|

## Operations

### Create or Detect Forgery (p. 138)

Creating a forgery takes 1d4 minutes and the GM rolls the check in secret so you are not sure how good the forgery is. The check is opposed by the Computers check of anyone who examines the document.

|Circumstance|DC Modifier|
|---|---|
|Document contradicts knowledge or orders|-2|
|Type of document is well known to examiner|-2|
|Type of document is unknown to examiner|+2|
|Examiner only casually reviews document|+2|
|Forger has a sample of a similar document|+8|

## Take 20 Skill Checks (p. 133, 139, 142, 143, 145, 146, 430)

The following skill checks can only be performed with a Take 20 if you have access to an information network or downloaded data set.

|Skill|Reason|
|---|---|

|Life Science|Identify Creature, Recall Knowledge|
|Mysticism|Identify Creature, Identify Magic Item, Recall Knowledge|

|Profession|Recall Knowledge|

**1** Also requires being trained in Computers



## Modules

### Control Modules (p. 215)

|Module|Effect|Price|
|---|---|---|
|Simple Control|All computers are able to operate simple devices such as on/off switches and can activate or deactivate the connected device as instructed and this is not a specific module that must be installed.|-|
|Complex Control|Operate a complex device, such as a spy drone, starship, vehicle, or weapon turret. When operating a device that requires a skill check or attack roll, the controlling computer can allow a user to attempt  a skill check or attack roll, or the computer can attempt the skill check or attack roll itself. When making its own check, the computer is assumed to have an attack bonus equal to its tier, proficiency with any  weapon it controls, and a total skill bonus equal to 2.5 x its tier. It can also be used to control another computer.|10% of controlled device|

### Secure Data Modules (p. 215)

Secure data modules contain data limited to one general topic. Data behind a secure data module can only normally be accessed with root access or if permission is granted to a user. The secure data module is often placed behind its own firewall.

|Module|Effect|Price|
|---|---|---|
|Secure Data, Specific|Allows for data on a specific topic such as a video log, a financial ledger, or a building schematic.|1|
|Secure Data, Average|Allows for data on an average topic such as engineering specifications for a gun, a company’s employee database, or a large array of maps.|10|
|Secure Data, Large|Allows for data on a large topic such as the plans for a starship, a space station’s operations log, or a company’s master records.|100-1,000|

### Spell Chip Modules (p. 215, 216, 222, 224)

Spell Chips are Spell Gems that have been crafted into a computer chip to be slotted into a computer system. The rules for using a spell chip are the same as those for using a spell gem which means you must be a spellcaster whose class spell list includes the spell on the chip and must have a high enough key ability score to cast it. If the spell chip’s item level is higher than the user’s caster level, they must succeed at a caster level check with a DC equal to the spell chip’s item level +1 or they fail to cast the spell and it remains in the chip to be attempted to use again. The user gains a +2 circumstance bonus to any skill check involving these spells. When a spell is expended from the chip, it is not destroyed and can be reloaded with the same spell for a price. If crafting your own spell chip, you must know the spell you’re encoding and if it requires expensive materials as part of its casting, you must provide those while crafting and the price is increased by the price of the components. You can create compound spell chips with a price equal to the total price of all spells stored within it.

|Spell Level|Item Level|Price|Reload Price|
|---|---|---|---|
|0|1|55|50|
|1st|2|154|137|
|2nd|5|495|446|
|3rd|8|1,540|1,386|
|4th|11|4,070|3,663|
|5th|14|11,660|10,494|
|6th|17|40,315|36,284|

## Countermeasures

### Alarm, Feedback, Lockout, and Wipe Countermeasures (p. 217)

|Countermeasure|Effect|Price|
|---|---|---|
|Alarm|This program sends an alert to a specific individual or station if someone attempts to breach the system.|10|
|Feedback|This countermeasure unleashes virus software into any system that tries to hack it. If you fail a check to hack the computer by 5 or more, any device used in the attempt is infected and becomes unreliable resulting in a -5 penalty to all skill checks involving the infected equipment. You can remove the virus if you succeed at a Computers check with the same DC as hacking the computer that has the feedback countermeasure.|500|
|Lockout|This countermeasure freezes a system if a user repeatedly fails attempts to access it causing it to become entirely inaccessible. Lockouts can last for any specified amount of time after any number of failed attempts. A lockout cannot be disabled even by a user with the correct password and credentials, but it is possible to bypass the lockout by accessing physical components of the computer, requiring a successful Engineering check with the same DC as the check to hack the computer.|100|
|Wipe|This countermeasure deletes specified data when an unauthorized breach is detected. Information deleted through a wipe can be recovered with 8 hours of work and a successful Computers check with a DC equal to 10 + the DC to hack the computer.|10|

### Fake Shell Countermeasure (p. 217)

You automatically get a new check each minute with a cumulative +2 circumstance bonus until you discover the ruse. In addition to the base price, an additional price of 10% of the price of its control and data modules must be added.

|Tier|Base Price + Varies|DC to Detect|
|---|---|---|
|1|25|22|
|2|125|26|
|3|625|30|
|4|2,500|34|
|5|5,000|38|

|8|16,000|47|
|9|32,000|51|
|10|64,000|55|

### Shock Grid Countermeasure (p. 217)

This countermeasure has a stun and a kill setting. Normally, the stun setting happens first with a warning about lethal force should the intruder make another attempt. The stun forces all creatures within 10 feet of the terminal to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The lethal setting deal electricity damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the terminal, allowing a Reflex save for half damage. Only computers fixed permanently to a floor or similar surface can have shock grids. Each rank counts against the number of countermeasures a system can have.

|1|20|8d6 E|500|
|2|22|10d6 E|2,000|
|3|24|12d6 E|5,000|
