# EXTENDED TELEPATHY
*Source** _Pact Worlds pg. 191_  
You have expanded your latent telepathic powers.

**Prerequisites**: Limited telepathy racial trait.

**Benefit**: Increase the range of your limited telepathy by 30 feet.

**Special**: If you are a phrenic adept or have the Major Psychic Power feat and you also have Extended Telepathy, you can try to communicate telepathically with creatures you don’t share a common language with, as long as the creature understands one or more languages. This requires a full action to initiate and a successful Mysticism check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the creature’s CR). On a failed check, you can’t try to communicate telepathically with that creature again for 24 hours.
