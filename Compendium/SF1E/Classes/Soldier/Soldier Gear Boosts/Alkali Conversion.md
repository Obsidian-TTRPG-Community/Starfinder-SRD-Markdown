# Alkali Conversion 
(Ex; 7th Level)
source: Tech Revolution pg. 33
As a move action, you can adjust the payload of a weapon you wield that deals acid damage, briefly converting it into an alkaline and equally caustic substance. Until the end of your turn, your attacks with the weapon treat the acid resistance of targets as 5 lower (minimum 0) for the purposes of resisting the weaponâ€™s acid damage. At 15th level, the alkaline attacks instead treat the acid resistance of targets as 10 lower, and such attacks deal their minimum acid damage to targets immune to acid rather than dealing no damage.
