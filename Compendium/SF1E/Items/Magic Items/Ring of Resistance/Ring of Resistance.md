This ring grants you magic protection against attacks and effects to which you are particularly vulnerable. You gain an enhancement bonus to saving throws with your lowest base saving throw bonus. If two or three of your base saving throw bonuses are tied for lowest value, you select which category gains this bonus when you first put on the ring, and this choice does not change unless a different base saving throw bonus later becomes your lowest bonus. The bonus is determined by the model of theÂ _ring of resistance_.

| Mk. 2 | +2    |
| Mk. 3 | +3    |
