name:: Multiattack (EX)
source:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 154_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 151_, _Alien Archive pg. 155_, _Alien Archive 3 pg. 152_  
desc:: In addition to its standard melee or ranged attack, the creature has a multiattack entry. When making a full attack, the creature can make all the attacks listed in the multiattack entry at the attack bonuses listed, rather than make two attacks. It can make the attacks in any order.

_Format_: **Multiattack** bite +10 (1d4+11), 2 claws +10 (1d4+11).  
_Guidelines_: Use the appropriate damage column for the creature’s array for all attacks in the multiattack, and impose a –6 penalty on these attacks (rather than the usual –4 penalty for a full attack).
