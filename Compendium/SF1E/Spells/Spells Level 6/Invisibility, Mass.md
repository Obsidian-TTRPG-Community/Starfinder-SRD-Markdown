## DESCRIPTION

This spell functions like _invisibility_, except the effect moves with the group and is broken when anyone in the group attacks. Individuals in the group canâ€™t see one another. Any individual who moves more than 180 feet from the nearest member of the group loses the benefit of this spell. If only two individuals are affected, the one moving away from the other one loses its invisibility. If both are moving away from each other, they both become visible when the distance between them exceeds 180 feet.
