**Offensive Ability** absorb corpse 

**SPECIAL ABILITIES**  
Absorb Corpse (Su) As a full action, Balco can touch a orpse to utterly obliterate it with negative energy, leaving nothing behind but a stain on the ground beneath any gear the corpse was wearing. For 1 minute afterward, all of his attacks deal an additional 1d4 cold damage. He can’t use this ability while in bright light.

**TACTICS**  
*Before Combat* 
Having just used his absorb corpse ability on Thali’s corpse, Balco deals additional cold damage with his attacks (which is factored in above) for the next minute.

*During Combat* 
Balco alternates between using dispiriting taunt on dangerous-looking foes, growling ominously at them, and shooting at the weakest-looking foe with his handcoil. If pressed by more than two enemies in melee, he retreats and attempts to hide to better take his opponents by surprise later.

*Morale*
Balco fights until destroyed or until the PCs successfully talk him down, as described above.
