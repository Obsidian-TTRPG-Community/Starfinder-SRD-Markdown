Effect: The _apprehending_ fusion causes the weapon to grow spikes and overwrought iron fixtures, as befits its use by the Hellknights. When an _apprehending_ weapon hits an enemy, you can activate the fusion as a reaction to perform a trip combat maneuver against that target with the same attack bonus as for the weapon attack. Additionally, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the weapon’s item level + the ability score modifier you apply to attack rolls with the weapon) or be unable to cast spells or spell-like abilities for 1 round. Once the weapon has used this ability, it cannot use it again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.
