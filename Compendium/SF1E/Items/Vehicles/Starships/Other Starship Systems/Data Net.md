# Data Net

**PCU**:: 5
**Cost (in BP)**:: 3  
Aballonian vessels have a complex communications net, allowing them to share sensor data and tactical plans. A ship must have this system to participate in a data net, and a participating ship can go no further than long range from the closest vessel and remain in the net.   
Ships with a data net determine their sensor distance to a target by counting the hexes between the target and any vessel participating in the network. In addition, if any vessel in the data net successfully performs a scan, target system, or lock on action against a target, all vessels in the net share that information and bonus. If the vessel was targeting a system, only the first critical damage is applied to the targeted system. Multiple lock-on bonuses do not stack. These shared bonuses apply even if the ship that performed the initial action is destroyed or disabled.
