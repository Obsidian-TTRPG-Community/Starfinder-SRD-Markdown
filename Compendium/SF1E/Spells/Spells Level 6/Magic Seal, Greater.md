## Description

You create a seal that suppresses magic in an area, which radiates from a creature or an object and moves with that target. An unwilling target can attempt a saving throw against this spell and use its spell resistance, and the sealed area fails to manifest if either defense works. If you target a point, the effect is stationary  
  
. Once the field is established, each round a creature starts even partially in the area, that creature is affected as if by a _magic seal_ spell, and can attempt a saving throw and apply its spell resistance against the effect. A creature that saves one round might be affected the next. The effect also ends on a creature that leaves the area, but the creature can be affected again if it reenters the area. In any case, a creature protected by its spell resistance can't be affected again by the same casting of this spell.
