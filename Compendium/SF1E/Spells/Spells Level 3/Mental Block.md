## Description

You cause targets of this spell to lose access to their procedural memory, preventing them from using any feat, extraordinary ability, spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability that requires an action of any kind. Each round at the end a targetâ€™s turn, that target can attempt another Will save to end this effect.
