### DESCRIPTION

This lattice of wires and sensors is worn atop the head. You can activate or deactivate a machimind as a swift action. While worn and active, a machimind lets you telepathically communicate with creatures within 60 feet that have machine telepathy or the technological subtype. You can also communicate through unprotected technological devices (or those to which you already have access), such as a datapad or comm unit, at a range of 30 feet.
