The Drift gauntlet can’t enter the Drift; if you’re on a starship that engages its Drift engine while you’re wearing it, you and the gauntlet get left behind. Once per day, you can grasp a creature or object with the Drift gauntlet and force it into the Drift. A creature can avoid this fate with a successful Will save (DC = 20 + your key ability score modifier); otherwise, it’s cast into the Drift and must find its own means of escape. An unattended object you grasp is automatically forced into the Drift as long as it fits within a 10-foot cube. If you use this ability on a starship’s Drift en
