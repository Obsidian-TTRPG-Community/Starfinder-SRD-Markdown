Psychic ability is common among the erahthi, the wood- aligned elemental beings who inhabit the forest world of Kir-Sharaat. Those erahthi psychics who seek adventure beyond their homeworld are often referred to as “heartreaders”, as their ability to divine emotion seems to give them the ability to read the truest desires of the heart. In reality, it is the heartreader’s skill with enchantment that makes it seem so; victims believe they were following their own heart when they were in truth serving the erahthi’s agenda instead.

Despite this power, most erahthi heartreaders do not manipulate those around them for personal gain. Many seek knowledge of new places and cultures, having little or no experience off their homeworld. Heartreaders merely find it expeditious to ensure conversations lead where the they want them to lead, rather than trusting to chance. Predictably, this approach is often met with hostility, despite the fact that the erahthi intended little deliberate harm.
