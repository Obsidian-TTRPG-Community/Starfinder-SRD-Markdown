## Cult Initiate Cr 4

---

## Description

Cult initiates see to the basic needs of the cult, quietly acquire resources, and mislead or kill those who ask too many questions about the cult's activities. They also learn about those who are interested in the cult, deciding whether those people should be inducted, thrown off the trail, or quietly eliminated. Sometimes initiates lead their own small groups of impressionable street gang members. Not all initiates are true believers, and they might be shaken out of their allegiance by persistent dialogue from the cult's enemies, but many are too committed to let goâ€”often because they have already done terrible things in the cult's name.
Adaptation: A cult initiate can be the envoy of any religious order with a need for secrecy. This stat block can also serve as a drow smuggler by switching the race to drow (Starfinder Alien Archive 42).
Cultists follow a fringe religion, often one deemed dangerous or even illegal by the surrounding society. The most common and dangerous cults in the Pact Worlds are those devoted to evil deities such as Lao Shu Po, Nyarlathotep, Urgathoa, and Zon-Kuthon. However, many other cults exist, worshiping such diverse entities as archdevils (especially Asmodeus), demon lords (especially Lamashtu), the Devourer, and alien Outer Gods.
Regardless of the object of their worship, cultists must operate in the shadowy parts of society where their unwanted or illegal activities can go unnoticed. They lurk in frontier areas without strong authorities, such as the Diaspora or Fullbright on Verces, or behind innocent-seeming fronts within settlements or on space stations. Many stalk the poorer districts of Absalom Station, hiding within the multitudinous population and taking advantage of disaffected citizens. A particular large and brazen cult might be more blatant about its activities, though the members still hide themselves away behind fortified walls and laser turrets when the authorities wish to speak to them.
