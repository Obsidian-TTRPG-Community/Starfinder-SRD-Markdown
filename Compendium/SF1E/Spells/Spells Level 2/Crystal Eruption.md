## DESCRIPTION

You force unstable magic into the ground, causing jagged crystals to erupt in the area. Creatures in the area and in contact with the ground when the spell first takes effect take 2d8 piercing damage. The crystals remain for the spellâ€™s duration, making the affected area difficult terrain that deals 1d4 piercing damage to a creature any time they move into an affected square on foot.
