Effect: Developed by telepathic creatures such as the psychic gas oozes inhabiting Preluria, the _mind-reading_ fusion reverberates with psychic feedback. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the _mind-reading_ fusion, you automatically read the surface thoughts of the creature struck. This is a mind-affecting ability. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the mind-reading effect.
