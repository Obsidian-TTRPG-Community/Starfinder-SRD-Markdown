The vibrogarrote is similar to an analog garrote, but the handle contains a battery pack to power the weapon, and the garrote wire produces a coherent, cutting sound. When used, the vibrogarrote makes a distinctive pitch based on how long the wire has been extended. Basic, harmonic, and interference vibrogarrotes produce only audible frequencies, while infrasonic and ultrasonic vibrogarrotes also generate waves outside the typical auditory spectrum for additional damage.

# Sonic Weapons

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
