# YASAKAJA - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 147_  
Native to the jungles of the isolated continent of Ukulam on Castrovel, yasakajas are furred quadrupeds with four eyes, a fox-like tail, and enormous, insectile mandibles. Yasakajas are known for being sturdy mounts with great endurance and superb mobility.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Agile Mount (Ex)** While mounted on your yasakaja companion, reduce the DC of Survival checks to fast mount or dismount, leap, or spur mount by an amount equal to the yasakaja’s level (to a minimum of 0).

**Mandibles (Ex, 5th level)** When a yasakaja scores a critical hit against a living creature with its mandibles attack, the naturally occurring acid in its saliva seeps into the wound, imposing the corrode (1d4) critical hit effect. A 10th- to 14th-level yasakaja’s corrode deals 2d4 damage, and a 15th-level or higher yasakaja’s corrode deals 4d4 damage. This is a poison effect.
