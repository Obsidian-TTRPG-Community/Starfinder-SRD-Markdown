## Description

You supercharge the target armor. The armorâ€™s hardness doubles; the armor sheds light in a 20-foot radius, increasing the light level 1 step to a maximum of normal light; and the creature wearing the armor gains temporary Hit Points equal to 5 + your caster level as long as it wears the armor.
