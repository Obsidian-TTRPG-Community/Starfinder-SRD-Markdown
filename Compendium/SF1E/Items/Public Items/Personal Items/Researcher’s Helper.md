### Description

Preferred by discerning solo researchers or urogs without access to capable research assistance, this small sphere of silicone stretches to cover one of your visual sensors. When it does, it generates an electromagnetic field that assists with reviewing information. You can apply the researcher’s helper as a standard action. When you do, it automatically aids you on your next Life Science, Mysticism, or Physical Science skill check. You can’t receive aid from any other source while using this item. After one skill check or 10 minutes, the researcher’s helper becomes inert and can be easily digested by urogs. The lingering electromagnetic field prevents you from benefiting from another researcher’s helper for 24 hours.
