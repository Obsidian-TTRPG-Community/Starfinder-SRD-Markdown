# MASK OF SCRAMBLING
This device resembles and functions as a mundane head accessory like eyeglasses, a mask, or a barrette. Once per day while wearing the device, you can activate it as a standard action to shroud your body in an imperceptible aura that disrupts technological sensors. For the effect’s duration, you and your gear are difficult to detect by cameras, motion detectors, biotech eyes and ears augmentations, and other technological devices, as well as by construct creatures with the technological subtype. To such sensors, your voice is incomprehensibly garbled, your footsteps indistinct, and your features blurred and treated as though you had concealment. This effect lasts for a duration based on its model, or until you end the effect as a standard action.
