# PRESCIENT LENSES
_Prescient lenses_ blend quantum computing and divination magic to model, extrapolate, and display events happening in the next few seconds as translucent holograms. A pair of lenses has one charge, which is refreshed each day, and a creature can benefit from a single use of _prescient lenses_ each day (with any subsequent attempt showing the same few seconds of time as the first daily use). _Prescient lenses_ were originally as optical enhancements for the robotic anacites of Aballon and can be integrated into a robot for the listed price. Alternatively, they can be installed as a cybernetic eye augmentation for 1,000 additional credits.  
  
**Mk 1**: You can study the image in the lenses as a move action and gain a +1 insight bonus to a single attack roll, ability check, or skill check attempted before the start of your next turn. Attempting an attack roll or check expends the charge.  
  
**Mk 2**: These function as _mk 1 prescient lenses_, but you can instead roll the attack roll or check twice and take the better of the two results.  
  
**Mk 3**: These function as _mk 2 prescient lenses_, but as a reaction you can instead reroll a failed attack roll, ability check, or skill check.
