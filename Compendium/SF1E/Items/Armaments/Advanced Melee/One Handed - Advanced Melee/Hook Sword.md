### Description

A larger cousin of the hook knife, the hook sword is a longsword with a pronounced hook at one edge of the bladeâ€™s tip. This barb not only deals gouging wounds, but it can also be used to trip an unwary foe. The drow invented the hook sword based on their design for the hook knife, but the weapon can be found all over the galaxy in the hands of brutal fighters.
