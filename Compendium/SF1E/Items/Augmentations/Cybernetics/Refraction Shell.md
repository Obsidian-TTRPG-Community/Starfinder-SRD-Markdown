# Refraction Shell

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 89_  
**Level**:: 11
**Price**::  25000 
**System**:: Arm and hand  
Silvery, flexible plates cover much of your body, thickening and hardening along your back. When you succeed at your saving throw against a line effect or such an effect misses you, as a reaction you can spend 1 Resolve Point to redirect the line, altering its direction up to 90 degrees beginning with your space. After you activate the refraction shell, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.
