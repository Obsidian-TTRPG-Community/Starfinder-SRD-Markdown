A solar brand consists of a flat plate that fits against the back of the hand, secured with a grip or a band. Once activated, the solar brand generates a protruding, arrowhead-shaped field of plasma. A red star solar brand doesn’t leave devastating marks, but the stronger yellow star, white star, and blue star models can cause lasting damage.

# PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
