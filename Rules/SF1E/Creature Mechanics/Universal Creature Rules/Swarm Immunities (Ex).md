# SWARM IMMUNITIES (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 156_, _Alien Archive pg. 157_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 153_  
Swarms are immune to the following effects, unless the effect specifies it works against swarms.

-   Bleeding, critical hits, flat-footed, off-target, pinned, prone, staggered, and stunned.
-   Combat maneuvers—swarms can’t be affected by and can’t perform combat maneuvers, unless the swarm’s description says otherwise.
-   Flanking—swarms are unflankable.
-   Dying—a swarm reduced to 0 Hit Points breaks up and ceases to exist as a swarm, though individual members of it might survive.

_Format_: **Immunities** swarm immunities.
