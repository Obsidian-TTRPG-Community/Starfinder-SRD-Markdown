# PHOTOSYNTHESIS GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 146_  
**Item Level** 1; **Price** 300; **System** Skin  
Like ghorans’ skin, your skin can undergo photosynthesis, providing you with nutrition without the need to eat (though you can eat if you wish). You can go without light (either sunlight or UV light, such as from starships) for 3 days, after which you must attempt Constitution checks to avoid starvation.
