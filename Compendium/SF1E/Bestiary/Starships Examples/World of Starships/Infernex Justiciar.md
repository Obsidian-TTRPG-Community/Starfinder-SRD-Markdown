## DESCRIPTION

Hellknights steadfastly enforce the laws of legitimate states, but where lawlessness reigns, the Justiciar’s jurisdiction begins. At least, that is the precept written into the Hellknights’ codes, and in typical fashion, they follow this mission mercilessly and without exception.  
  
Justiciar destroyers function as forward bases and training facilities for Hellknights, especially in territories in the lawless or unsettled Vast that have never—as far as the zealots are concerned—felt the touch of true order. Smaller craft often refuel at these ships to carry out missions throughout a system, returning to recuperate and drop off captured convicts for trial and sentencing. However, should smaller ships such as the Infernex Unshakable lack the firepower to pursue a fugitive or the influence to demand obedience from anarchic settlements, a Justiciar can rapidly travel to ongoing chaotic flash points to mete out justice.  
  
These engagements are where a Justiciar truly excels. Such ships rarely carry fewer than 100 Hellknights and armigers-in-training, and a single ship is capable of subduing small colonies and detaining wanted criminals. If a settlement steadfastly refuses to surrender any villains it’s sheltering, a Justiciar’s crew doesn’t hesitate to unleash a devastating rain of artillery fire from high orbit, leveling entire neighborhoods before again broadcasting its demand for compliance.  
  
In 301 ag, an Order of the Chain Justiciar infamously bombarded the refinery town of Hlagin on Hgonthi-5 for sheltering the kasathan pirate Eshum Za of Clan Tolar, wiping it off the map. The assault resulted in the town receiving generous reparations from the Pact Worlds’ governmental branches, while the Pact Council issued stern complaints to the Hellknight order responsible. Despite this, the ship’s captain received a commendation from his superiors for his merciless resolve, and the event sent a chilling message to other would-be havens. When a Justiciar appears in the skies, many colonies kick out known fugitives and casual scallywags alike to spare their citizens from the possibility of becoming collateral damage.  
  
Impossibly optimistic schemes for commandeering a Justiciar regularly surface on infospheres, and Hellknight crews vigilantly prepare for outlaws foolish enough to launch a raid.
