eGoblin legend claims that long ago, a tribe of surprisingly clever goblins stowed away on a spacecraft that left Golarion and made its way to Absalom Station, where the goblins infiltrated the station’s worst neighborhoods and set up camps in its engineering passages. Over time, the goblins learned to build weapons and armor from scavenged parts, though many of their efforts are prone to exploding at the slightest provocation. While space goblins have since managed to hijack other ships and spread to the stars, nowhere are they as prevalent as on Absalom Station—a fact for which all other worlds that are familiar with space goblins are extremely grateful.

Thanks to the goblins’ rapid reproduction rate, many generations have passed since those first goblins came to Absalom Station. Fluctuating gravity, an entirely new diet, and the occasional radiation leak have made space goblins a distinct offshoot species from Golarion’s goblins. They are a bit more intelligent, instinctively able to take apart technology and rebuild it to suit their strange whims. They are quicker as well, scuttling rapidly into nearby ventilation ducts after swiping unattended datapads or laser pistols.

While some space goblins still worship the goblin hero-gods of old, partially adapting their dogma to fit their current lifestyle, many more revere Triune, the machine god. Their innate aptitude for using technology (without knowing how it actually works) leads them to believe that Triune has a plan for them. Some even think it will lead them to some kind of scavenging paradise, where every dawn will bring a new piece of advanced technology to strip for parts. However, neither Triune nor its church has yet officially acknowledged these zealous space goblins.

Goblins from Golarion were known for their voracious appetites, often eating their body weight each day of what passed for cuisine in the twisted mind of a goblin. Space goblins were not afforded that luxury in those early days aboard Absalom Station; they had to subsist on discarded scraps of food and other garbage. As such, space goblins aren’t as insatiable, though they are no less orally fixated. There is an even chance that upon encountering a strange item, a space goblin will try to either dismantle it or eat it. A space goblin might even attempt to diagnose a problem with a small piece of technology by putting it in his mouth and tasting every part of it.

Goblins’ instinctive hatred and fear of dogs and horses has also adapted over the millennia. Space goblins tend to refer to any quadruped (or anything shaped even remotely similarly) that they dislike as a “dog” or “horse,” depending on its size. In that vein, they still refer to their iconic crude melee weapons as dogslicers; these function just like survival knives, though a few enterprising goblin tribes have discovered ways to give the blades microserrated or ultraserrated edges. Other tribes have taken to adapting flame pistols and flame rifles to suit their needs, dubbing them “horseroasters.”

The physical differences between space goblins and their cousins from Golarion (none of which have been seen for centuries) are slight. Space goblins tend to be a few inches taller, and their eyes are a deeper shade of red. A typical space goblin is about 3-1/2 feet tall and weighs about 35 pounds—most of that weight is in the head.

**Organization** gang (4–12) or tribe (13+ plus 13+noncombatants, 1 honchohead of CR 2–3, and 5–6 alien pets)

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Disturbing Screech (Ex)** As a standard action, a space goblin honchohead can let out a screech that puts all non-goblinoid creatures within 30 feet on edge. Each affected creature must succeed at a DC 13 Will saving throw or gain the off-target condition for 1d4 rounds. Whether successful or not, a creature can’t be affected by the same space goblin honchohead’s disturbing screech for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting, sense-dependent effect.

**Tinker (Ex)** As a move action, a space goblin can remove the penalties associated with the broken condition from a single piece of equipment until the start of his next turn. The item then becomes unusable for 10 minutes (and retains the broken condition after that until it is fixed).

**Unstable Junklaser (Ex)** A space goblin’s laser pistol is crafted from a mishmash of broken casings, leaking energy cells, and other random material. A junklaser is similar to an azimuth laser pistol, except it has a range of only 60 feet. If the wielder of a junklaser rolls a natural 1 when attacking with it, he must immediately attempt a DC 18 Engineering check. Success means that the junklaser gains the broken condition. Failure means that the gun explodes in 1d3–1 rounds, functioning as a concussion grenade I (explode \[20 ft., 1d8 B, DC 10\]); a result of 0 rounds means the junklaser explodes immediately—randomly determine the corner of the wielder’s square that is the center of the burst. A thrown junklaser has the same range increment as a grenade.
