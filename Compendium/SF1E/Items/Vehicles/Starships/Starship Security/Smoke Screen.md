Mounted on the underside of a ship, this device, when activated, emits a thick cloud of smoke and mist that billows forth constantly for one minute. During this time, all creatures directly underneath the ship have total concealment
those within 20 feet of the ship have varying degrees of concealment determined by the GM.
