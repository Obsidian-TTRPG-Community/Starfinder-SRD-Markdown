    desc: "When a cybernetic golem takes damage that reduces it to half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, and whenever it takes damage while it has half its maximum Hit Points or fewer, it must attempt a DC 15 Will saving throw. On a failure, the golem goes berserk. While berserk, the golem uses its actions to make a full attack or to move and attack. If it can’t reach or shoot a creature, it attacks objects. The golem can attempt a DC 15 Will saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the berserk state. If the golem’s creator communicates with the golem to calm it, via comm unit or from within 60 feet, and succeeds at a DC 10 Charisma check, the golem receives a +2 circumstance bonus to this saving throw."

However, such an effect merely breaks any slow effect on the golem and heals it for 1 Hit Point per 3 damage the effect would have dealt. Any damage that exceeds the golem’s maximum Hit Points is stored as charges for its weapons, at a rate of 1 charge per Hit Point the golem would have gained. Any additional damage is ignored."

## Cybernetic Golem Cr 8

These automatons, created by powerful spellcasters, differ from most robots in that each has an elemental spirit bound within. Properly binding this spirit, which is usually from an earth elemental, is the most important part of creating a golem. As the spirit is only semiconscious, the golem exists in a mindless state and acts only to defend itself or to follow orders from its creator. In some golems, injury causes the elemental spirit to stir in its artificial shell. As it gains awareness, it rages at its imprisonment.
