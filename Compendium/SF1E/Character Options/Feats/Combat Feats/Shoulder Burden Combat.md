Benefit: At the beginning of your turn, you can choose to ignore the encumbered condition and treat the overburdened condition as though you were instead encumbered for a number of rounds equal to your Strength modifier. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. In addition, the encumbered condition reduces your speeds by 5 feet (rather than by 10 feet), and the overburdened condition reduces your speeds to 10 feet (rather than to 5 feet).
Prerequisites: Str 15, character level 5th.
