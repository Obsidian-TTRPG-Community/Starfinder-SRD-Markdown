type:: Ex
level:: 7th 
source:: Galactic Magic pg. 33
desc:: When you hit a creature with an analog weapon that deals bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, you can hamper the target’s movement for 1 round (Reflex negates). While hampered, the creature’s speed is reduced by half, and it can’t perform guarded steps. Once a creature attempts a save against this gear boost, it’s immune to the ability for 24 hours.
