TACTICS

**During Combat** The zealot overlord is an incredibly powerful opponent, but he is most dangerous because he is cautious. He tries not to get caught in melee at all if he can manage, hiding behind his mechanical angels as he tosses his most powerful spells at the PCs. His care extends into his spell casting, preferring to protect himself with greater resistant armor, unwilling guardian, and wall of fire to more offensive options. He tries to keep an angel near him at all times to have access to guarding wings, saving a legendary power point for legendary reconstruction. Once his protecting angel has died or turned against him, he’ll consider direct damage like chain surge and heat leech.

SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### LEGENDARY SURGE

Roth has a pool of 5 legendary power points. When he rolls a d20, he can spend a legendary power point as a reaction after the results are revealed to add 1d6 to the result of the roll. This can change the outcome of the roll.

#### LEGENDARY RECONSTRUCTION (EX)

When Roth is reduced to zero hit points, he can spend a legendary power point (see Legendary Surge) to rebuild and rewire his body, immediately healing 120 hit points and permanently changing his creature type permanently to construct (gaining the construct immunities defensive ability). He can use this ability once per day, but the change in creature type is permanent.
