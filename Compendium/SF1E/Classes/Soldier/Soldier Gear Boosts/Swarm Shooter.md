# Swarm Shooter 
(Ex; 3rd Level)
source: Tech Revolution pg. 33
When you use a weapon that deals damage to multiple targets, it deals additional damage to creatures with the swarm defenses special ability as though the weapon affected all creatures in its area. When you use a ranged weapon that would normally affect only a single target against a creature with the swarm defenses ability, you can deal half damage to the target instead of no damage.
