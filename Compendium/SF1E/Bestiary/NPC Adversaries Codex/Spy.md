# Spy

Infiltrators are skilled at sneaking in and out of restricted places. Although different types of infiltrators may have similar goals, their methods for avoiding or compromising guards and security measures differ greatly: shapeshifters rely on their ability to become someone else, spies are masters of remaining undetected, hackers can easily break into both physical locations and computer systems to steal information, and double agents are trained to maintain a cover and lie about their allegiances.  
In adventures, infiltrators are most often encountered as antagonists who are planning to break into a secure facility to carry out acts of espionage or sabotage or to exfiltrate prisoners. Depending on the type of gig in question, infiltrators may work with assassins or thieves

## Description

Spies often engage in corporate espionage, infiltrating secure locations to steal intellectual property such as plans or prototypes for new types of weapons, engines, medicine, or cybernetics. In times of war, spies are needed to gather military intelligence behind enemy lines. In either case, a spy most often relies on stealth to sneak past guards, leaving as little evidence as possible about their presence.  
Despite their preference for subterfuge, spies rarely hesitate to dispatch with anyone who gets in the way of their mission.
