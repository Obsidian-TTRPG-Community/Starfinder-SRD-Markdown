This upgrade instantaneously alters gravity around you, jarring nearby creatures. When you activate this upgrade as a standard action, you choose whether it affects a 5-, 10-, or 15-foot-radius emanation centered on you. Other creatures in the area are flat-footed unless they succeed at a Reflex save, and if they fail the save by 5 or more, they’re also knocked prone as if tripped by a successful combat maneuver.
