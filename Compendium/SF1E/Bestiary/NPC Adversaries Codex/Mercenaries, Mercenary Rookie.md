# Mercenaries, Mercenary Rookie

Mercenaries work for the highest bidder, generally with no questions asked (except by those who belong to the Skyfire Legion and a few other more principled companies). Mercenaries can serve the interests of almost any faction with enough credits, but most often they work for employers who can't employ a formal military force or who can't be seen getting their own hands dirty. Since their ultimate goal is simply to get paid, mercenaries are rarely willing to fight to the death unless they fear failure will ruin them completely anyway. If approached with an appealing offer, some particularly ruthless mercenaries are willing to betray their employers, but their new loyalty is just as fickle. Many mercenaries know that changing sides in the middle of a job could ruin their reputations, so they are therefore willing to be bought off only in a way that they can plausibly deny later or that will make them so much money that they will be set for life. There are countless mercenary groups throughout the Pact Worlds, ranging from large and acclaimed to small and obscure. Many groups specialize in certain types of missions; some take on only jobs that put them on the battlefield, while others prefer to stick to the shadows. Mercenary groups accept a variety of forms of payment, from hard credits to technological gear and weapons to magic items.

### Ecology

## Description

Even rookie mercenaries are usually recruited only after they have demonstrated prowess in one of any number of militaries or in a security role elsewhere. Many left their previous positions hoping for more freedom, more money, or more glory. As such, they tend to have their own ideas about how to get things done. They might show off or play fast and loose with their orders—at least until they are faced with a foe that seems truly dangerous. More successful mercenary rookies, however, tend to approach the task like they would military service with loftier motives, and they take pride in professionally following orders. With a handful of successful missions under his belt, a mercenary is no longer considered a rookie, and he often has the scars to show for it. At this point, he is usually referred to as a grunt and might be working his way up the chain of command with an eye on becoming a captain or taking on another leadership role.  
**Adaptation:** A mercenary rookie can be a well-equipped fighter serving any government (although if the rookie isn't working for the Veskarium, he is most likely not a vesk) or security for a major corporation.
