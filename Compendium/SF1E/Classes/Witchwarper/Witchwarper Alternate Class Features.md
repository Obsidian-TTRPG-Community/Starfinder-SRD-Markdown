# Witchwarpter Alternate Class Features

# Infinite Tech (SU)

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 38_  
**Class** Witchwarper

As a full action, you can expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to conjure from a parallel existence one suit of light armor, one basic melee weapon, or one small arm that functions only for you. Conjured gear has an item level equal to your caster level and comes fully loaded with ammunition (if it uses ammo) or a fully charged battery (if it uses charges). The item persists until you dismiss it as a standard action, until it’s more than 10 feet away from you for more than a minute, or until its duration runs out, after which it fades back to its original reality. Any additional components incorporated into the item (such as spare ammunition) harmlessly drop into the item’s space when the item disappears.  
As part of conjuring an armor or weapon, you can install one or more armor upgrades or weapon fusions into the conjured gear, up to the maximum allowed by the armor’s upgrade slots or weapon’s item level. For each upgrade or fusion applied in this way, you must spend 1 Resolve Point.  
When you conjure armor, you either don the armor as part of activating this ability (causing any armor you were already wearing to disappear until the ability ends), or you can cause the armor to appear in your space. The armor’s EAC bonus equals your witchwarper level, the KAC bonus equals your witchwarper level +2, the maximum Dexterity bonus is +4, the armor has no armor check penalty, and it has 1 armor upgrade slot (possibly more, based on the expended spell’s level). The armor’s duration is 1 hour per witchwarper level.  
When you conjure a basic melee weapon or small arm, it appears either in one of your empty hands or in your space. When activating this ability, choose whether the weapon deals energy damage (your choice of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage) or kinetic damage (your choice of bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage). In addition, the weapon gains one weapon special ability it qualifies for from the following list: block, conceal, disarm, feint, harrying, nonlethal, operative, penetrating, reach, reposition, thrown (20 feet), or trip.  
A weapon that deals energy damage deals 1d4 damage of the chosen type, and a basic melee weapon gains the powered weapon special property. A weapon that deals kinetic damage deals 1d6 damage of the chosen type and has the analog weapon special property. Any conjured small arm has a range increment of 50 feet, usage 1, and capacity 20 (charges if it deals energy damage or rounds if it deals kinetic damage). The damage dealt by the conjured weapon increases by one damage die at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter (maximum 6 dice at 20th level). The weapon’s duration is 10 minutes.  
Conjured gear gains additional benefits based on the level of the spell slot expended to summon it (see below). You select these special benefits each time you conjure an item with this ability. The conjured gear must always qualify for any special properties and critical hit effects you apply to it.  
**2nd (armor):** The armor grants you resistance 5 to one of the following damage types: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic.  
**2nd (weapon):** The weapon gains one critical hit effect chosen from the following: bind AR, blind, deafen, demoralize AR, knockdown, sicken AR, staggered, stifle AR, wound.  
**3rd (armor):** As 2nd level, but your armor’s EAC and KAC bonuses increase by 1.  
**3rd (weapon):** As 2nd level, but your weapon gains a second special property.  
**4th (armor):** As 3rd level, but your armor gains a second armor upgrade slot.  
**4th (weapon):** As 3rd level, but your weapon’s base damage increases to 1d6 (for energy damage) or 1d8 (for kinetic damage).  
**5th (armor):** As 4th level, but your armor’s resistance applies to two damage types.  
**5th (weapon):** As 4th level, but your weapon gains a third special property.  
**6th (armor):** As 5th level, but your armor’s resistances each increase to 10, and it gains a third armor upgrade slot.  
**6th (weapon):** As 5th level, but your weapon’s base damage increases to 1d8 (for energy damage) or 1d10 (for kinetic damage).  
The infinite tech class feature replaces infinite worlds.

# Infinity Lash (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 38_  
**Class** Witchwarper

As a move action, you can form a whiplike strand of energy whose strikes tear away slivers of matter and replace them with alternate reality analogues to painful effect. This infinity lash functions as a magical one-handed basic melee weapon that disappears if it ever leaves your hand. It deals 1d4 slashing damage and has the analog and reach special properties.  
As a move action while holding your infinity lash, you can expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to empower the infinity lash for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. This increases the damage dealt by your infinity lash by +1d4 per level of the spell slot expended, or by +2d4 per level of the spell slot expended if the spell slot expended was 5th level or higher. This also grants the weapon additional effects based on the level of spell slot expended as follows.  
**1st:** You can deliver spells with a range of touch using your infinity lash’s reach rather than your natural reach. Your infinity lash gains the sicken critical hit effect. If your infinity lash has multiple critical hit effects, you can apply any one of those effects when you score a critical hit with the weapon.  
**2nd:** As 1st level, plus you can change the damage your infinity lash deals to one of the following of your choice: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. Your infinity lash targets KAC.  
**3rd:** As 2nd level, plus your infinity lash gains the disarm and trip special properties.  
**4th:** As 3rd level, plus your infinity lash gains the staggered critical hit effect.  
**5th:** As 4th level, plus your infinity lash gains the enfeeble critical hit effect.  
**6th:** As 5th level, plus when you score a critical hit, you can select two critical hit effects to apply to the target. Infinity lash replaces infinite worlds.

# Plunderer of Worlds (SU)

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 49_  
**Class** Witchwarper

Much as the Drift tears away pieces of other planes, you snag extraplanar energies from the Great Beyond. Twice per day as a standard action, you can project a random plane’s features into a nearby space. Roll on Table 1–2 to determine which plane is affected. After determining the plane, you choose where this planar bubble appears, filling a 10-foot‑radius emanation within 100 feet of you. A planar bubble lasts a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. You can’t dismiss the bubble, though you can have more than one in existence at once. At 4th, 10th, and 16th levels, you can create one additional planar bubble per day.  
The planar bubble imposes various effects on creatures in its area, determined by the plane of origin. At 4th, 7th, 10th, 13th, and 16th levels, you gain additional ways to augment your bubbles by expending an unused witchwarper spell slot. You can expend only one spell slot in this way per bubble you create. You choose whether to expend a spell slot to augment a bubble after selecting its plane but before targeting the effect.  
At 1st level, the planar bubble applies the plane’s enhanced magic and impeded magic effects for any spells and spell-like abilities cast inside its area. Any spell that has a descriptor that matches one of the bubble’s enhanced traits functions as though the spell’s caster level were 2 higher than normal, has its saving throw DC increased by 1, and gains a +2 insight bonus to any attack rolls made with the spell. Any spell that has a descriptor that matches one of the bubble’s impeded traits is difficult to cast; the spellcaster must succeed at a caster-level check (1d20 + their caster level) with a DC equal to 15 + twice the spell’s level; otherwise, they fail to cast the impeded spell.  
At 4th level, you can expend a 1st-level spell slot to fill the area with difficult terrain, as the infinite worlds 1st-level environmental effect (Character Operations Manual 62).  
At 7th level, the bubble’s radius increases to 15 feet. You can expend a spell slot to expand the bubble further, increasing its radius by an amount equal to 5 × the spell slot’s level.  
At 10th level, you gain extraordinary control over your planar bubbles’ origins. You can expend a 2nd-level or higher spell slot when creating a bubble to roll its plane of origin a number of times equal to the expended spell’s level and choose one result.  
At 13th level, the planar bubble’s radius increases to 20 feet. In addition, you can expend a 4th-level spell slot to fill the planar bubble with dangerous matter or energy, dealing force damage equal 5 + your Charisma modifier when a creature enters or begins its turn in the bubble. Each subsequent round, the amount of damage the planar bubble inflicts decreases by 1 (minimum 0). A creature can’t take this damage more than once per round, and they take half as much damage with a successful Fortitude save. Any creatures that have the subtype, creature type, or special ability listed in the planar bubble’s immune entry take no damage from this effect, whereas creatures that have the subtype, creature type, or special ability listed in the bubble’s vulnerability entry instead take double damage from the effect. A creature that is both immune and vulnerable to the damage instead takes the normal amount of damage. At the GM’s discretion, a creature closely associated with the planar bubble’s origin might be immune or vulnerable to its effects (such as a Shadow Plane creature being immune to a shadowy planar bubble’s damage). You’re immune to your own bubble’s damage unless you’re vulnerable to its effects.  
At 16th level, you can expend a 6th-level spell slot as a standard action to end one of your planar bubbles prematurely. When you do so, the collapsing bubble attempts to draw one creature in its area back to the bubble’s plane of origin. This functions as plane shift, and an unwilling target can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. You can use this ability even if you’ve already expended a spell slot to modify the bubble. Plunderer of worlds replaces infinite worlds.

# Projected (SU)

**Source**:: Galactic Magic pg. 38
**Class** Witchwarper

You’ve irrevocably drawn yourself from another reality into this one. You don’t belong here, and this reality has trouble reconciling your presence. However, you’ve learned to exploit your inconsistent density, size, and sheer existence.
At 3rd level, you’ve learned to harness reality’s attempts to erase you. As a move action, you can flicker in and out of existence, granting you a 20% miss chance against attacks and reducing the damage you take from area effects by an amount equal to your witchwarper level. The miss chance increases to 25% at 9th level and to 30% at 15th level. Unlike the miss chance granted by concealment, the flicker effect’s miss chance isn’t overcome by special senses such as blindsight. You can flicker only for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level, though these rounds need not be consecutive.
At 6th level, you can trick reality into miscalculating your size. As a move action, you gain one of the following benefits: you gain the compressionAA ability, your size decreases by one size category, or your size increases by one size category. If this transformation would increase your size to Large or larger and your reach is less than 10 feet, your reach becomes 10 feet. If your size decreases to Small or Medium, your reach decreases by 5 feet (minimum 5 feet). If your size becomes Tiny or smaller, you reach decreases by 5 feet (minimum 0 feet).
The transformation lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). After you use this ability, you can’t do so again until after you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.
At 12th level, once per day as part of a move action, you can move through creatures and objects as though you were incorporeal (Core Rulebook 264). You can use this ability twice per day at 18th level.
Projected replaces the compound sight and alternate outcome class features.
