## DESCRIPTION

You concentrate on overlapping realities and focus them on the target. Once per round, even when it is not your turn, you can move your target up to 10 feet into a space it is willing and able to occupy. This movement can occur only between resolved actions and does not trigger reactions. When you concentrate on this spell, you can shift your focus to a different target.
