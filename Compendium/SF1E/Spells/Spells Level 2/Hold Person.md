## Description

The target becomes paralyzed and freezes in place. It is aware and breathes normally but can’t take any physical actions, even speech. A held creature can’t cast spells. Each round on its turn, the target can spend a full action to attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A winged creature that is paralyzed can’t flap its wings and falls. A swimmer can’t swim and may drown.
