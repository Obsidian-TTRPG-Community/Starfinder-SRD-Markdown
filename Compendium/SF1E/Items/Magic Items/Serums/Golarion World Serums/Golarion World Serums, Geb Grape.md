### Description

The label of this deep purple beverage features a bumbling cartoon zombie chasing after its own head as it rolls away. A slogan at the bottom of the label reads, “Chase the ghoulish flavor!” The serum grants you a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of undead creatures.
