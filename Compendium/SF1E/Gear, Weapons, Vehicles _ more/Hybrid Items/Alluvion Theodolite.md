# ALLUVION THEODOLITE
**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 55_  
**Level** 3; **Price** 1,750; **Bulk** 2

### DESCRIPTION

This clockwork precision instrument, often mounted on the bridge of a starship, allows you to glean the distance and direction of Alluvion, the itinerant city in the Drift. While you’re in the Drift, the theodolite gives you a +4 insight bonus to astrogate to Alluvion (though you must still have received coordinates from some other source).
