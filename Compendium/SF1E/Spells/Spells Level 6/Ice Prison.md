## Description

You encase a creature in a block of ice. The creature takes 8d6 cold damage and becomes paralyzed. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex saving throw halves the damage it takes and avoids becoming paralyzed. Each round on its turn, a paralyzed creature takes an additional 4d6 cold damage and can spend a full action to attempt a new saving throw to end the paralyzed effect. The ice prison has hardness 21, 51 Hit Points, and vulnerability to fire. If the ice prison is destroyed, the spell ends. Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
