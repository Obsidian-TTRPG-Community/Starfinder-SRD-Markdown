# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Bloodstone Bloodbrother

## Description

This figure of green stone mottled with red flecks can change into a bloodbrother. The bloodbrother starts with no creature in its rib cage prison and can’t deal Constitution damage, so it lacks fast healing. If the bloodbrother reverts to figurine form while a victim is in the bloodbrother’s rib cage prison, the victim is released in the bloodbrother’s space.
