Explorers often take precautions against known diseases. Vaccines must be formulated for a specific disease. One day after taking or being injected with a vaccine, you gain a bonus equal to 5 + the medicinal’s tier to saving throws against that disease for a number of months equal to the vaccine’s tier. This bonus does not stack with antibiotics.
