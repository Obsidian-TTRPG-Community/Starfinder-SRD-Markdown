A flame spinner consists of two weighted balls attached to a length of cable; the pair is spun in an elegant, showy dance of spinning fire. Fireball and immolation flame spinners use petrol to generate a flaming nimbus around the ballâ€™s metal casing, while supernova and fission flame spinners dispense with the casing and instead compress the petrol to generate a dense mass of blazing heat in place of each ball. Using a flame spinner effectively is difficult due to the complex handling required, and kasathas and other races with additional limbs find they have a substantial advantage in that regard.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
