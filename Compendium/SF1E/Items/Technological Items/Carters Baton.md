### Description

This flanged rod allows you to control gravitational forces around a single object within 100 feet. When you activate the baton, you can move an object of no more than 25 pounds or 2 bulk up to 20 feet per round in any direction (including up or down), but you can’t move it farther than 100 feet from you. If you attempt to move an object that another creature is holding, that creature can attempt a DC 15 Reflex save to prevent you from removing the object from its grasp.
