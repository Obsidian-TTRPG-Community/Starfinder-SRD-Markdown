## Description

Developed by kalo explorers as a deterrent when dealing with aquatic predators, you scream at your opponents, sending your voice rippling through air and water currents. All targets in the cone take 6d12 damage. If you cast this spell while submerged in liquid, the damage increases by 1d12, and creatures that fail their saving throw are nauseated for 1 round.
