## Cerebric Fungus Cr 3

Cerebric fungi are carnivorous plants, but they are also intelligent interstellar explorers with colonies in many star systems, including the Pact Worlds, where they have carved out homes in corners of Castrovel and the Liavaran moon Nchak. Within the colonies of their isolated home system in the Vast, cerebric fungi debate philosophy and mysticism to perfect their shared understanding of the universe and to outshine the intellectual insights of the other colonies.
In an effort to prove esoteric points on behalf of their home colonies—or to spite other colonies—cerebric fungi enjoy studying creatures less intelligent than themselves. The fungi have been pleased to find suitable subjects on other planets.
Cerebric fungi greet strangers they meet with telepathic questions that might seem inane or even senseless. The fungi have difficulty comprehending the needs and concerns of non-fungoid creatures and easily distress others with experiments meant not to harm but rather to test pet theories.
With millennia of starflight and space exploration informing their culture, cerebric fungi can offer information that other civilizations would otherwise have little chance of learning. However, it often takes much time, patience, and psychic fortitude for other creatures to interpret a cerebric fungus’s insights, as elements other creatures might consider necessary context, the fungus considers obvious or irrelevant. The typical cerebric fungus is approximately 4 feet in diameter and weighs 150 pounds.

## Fungal Computers

Cerebric fungi reproduce by budding. They can also grow specialized buds, removing them before they reach maturity, to produce living computers. By adjusting the timing and chemical mixture of this process, cerebric fungi can create computer modules and countermeasures that can be incorporated into any computer. Cerebric fungi sell their creations to fund further explorations. A fungal computer’s base cost is 10% higher than a normal computer and has the following traits.
Chemosynthesis: A fungal computer can synthesize its own energy from most atmospheres. This functions as a free self- CHArging upgrade.
Reticulated Spine: A fungal computer has a complex network and a fibrous core that can’t be reduced in size. No miniaturization upgrade can be applied to a fungal computer.
Telepathic Interface: A fungal computer has only a telepathic user interface (see the upgrade below). A hacking kit can access a fungal computer, but otherwise a typical computer with a complex control module must be purchased separately and installed to provide a digital interface for a fungal computer.
