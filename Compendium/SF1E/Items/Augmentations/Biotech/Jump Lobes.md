**System**:: Brain  
These neurological expansions were discovered by phentomite scientists studying their species’ brain anatomy in an attempt to increase success during complex and dangerous bridging operations. The additional lobes help to instill an instinctive grasp of the complex physics of low- and zero-gravity environments, and come with an instinctive knowledge of some of the hazards of space. You gain a +1 insight bonus to Athletics checks to jump and to Physical Science checks, and you can attempt Physical Science checks to recall knowledge even if untrained.
