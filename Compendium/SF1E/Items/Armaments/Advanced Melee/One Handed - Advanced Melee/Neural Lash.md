Similar to the living lash, a neural lash is a particularly flexible weapon that proves cumbersome to those without telepathic abilities. The neural lash has been bred to include bioelectric cells in addition to its neural fibers, delivering electricity damage and allowing the lash to deal nonlethal damage at its user’s direction. Barathu take credit for the development of the electroplax and amperometric neural lash, but later weapons manufacturers have improved upon those original models by developing the galvanic and voltaic neural lashes.

# Shock Weapons

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
