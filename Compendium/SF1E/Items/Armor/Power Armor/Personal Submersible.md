This bulky, bulbous armor is made of pressure-resistant plates with durable seals. Retractable ridges along the armor’s arms, legs, and back function as fins, providing increased mobility in most fluids. The armor grants you a swim speed and allows you to both breathe underwater and survive the pressure of thick atmospheres and great depths even when your environmental protections are not active.
