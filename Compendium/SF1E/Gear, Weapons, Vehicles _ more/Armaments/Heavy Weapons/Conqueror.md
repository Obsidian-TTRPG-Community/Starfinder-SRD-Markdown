# CONQUEROR
Conquerors are perhaps the largest and most difficult to handle of the plasma weapon category. A conquerer can deliver a single devastating blast of plasma, but the weapon is rather front-heavy and difficult to maneuver. Some vesk take up the weapon as a sign of their patron deity, Damoritosh, viewing it as the ranged spiritual equivalent of the doshko. In addition to the red star, yellow star, white star, and blue star models, the particularly powerful violet star conqueror has recently made its way onto the market.

### PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
