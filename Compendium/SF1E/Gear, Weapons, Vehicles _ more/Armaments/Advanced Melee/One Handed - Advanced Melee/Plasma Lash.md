A plasma lash has a sturdy, braided handle with a thick but flexible cord that divides into several narrower cables as it gets farther from the handle, each trailing lines of uncontained plasma. These weapons come in red star, yellow star, white star and blue star models.

# PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
