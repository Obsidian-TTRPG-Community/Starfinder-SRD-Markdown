The Undead of Eox, also known as Eoxians, are a renowned species hailing from the planet Eox within the Pact Worlds. They are a distinctive race of sentient undead beings who have forged their place in the interstellar community. Once a vibrant civilization of organic beings, they underwent a transformation into undeath many centuries ago.

**Physical Characteristics:** The Undead of Eox bear the hallmarks of their undead nature. Their bodies are skeletal in form, with bones exposed and adorned with intricate patterns and engravings. Luminescent energy pulses within the hollow cavities of their eye sockets, casting an eerie glow that varies in color from individual to individual. Their movements are graceful, almost ethereal, as they navigate the world with an otherworldly elegance.

**Necrografts and Technological Advancements:** The Undead of Eox have mastered a unique technology known as Necrografts. These specialized cybernetic enhancements are intricately designed to seamlessly integrate with undead physiology, allowing for the augmentation of their natural abilities. Necrografts can only be obtained on the planet Eox itself, where skilled artisans and surgeons craft these devices with unparalleled expertise. They serve as both practical tools and symbols of status within Eoxian society.

**Cultural Traits:** Eoxians possess a rich and complex culture deeply rooted in the understanding and exploration of undeath. They revere the preservation of knowledge, history, and the pursuit of personal power. Eoxian society is organized into noble houses, each with their own unique philosophies, traditions, and political aspirations. While some houses emphasize the acquisition of power through necromantic arts and warfare, others focus on scholarship, artistry, or technological advancements.

Interactions with Other Species: Eoxians have a varied reputation among the Pact Worlds due to their undead nature and the cultural differences that arise from it. Some view them with trepidation, associating them solely with death and undeath. However, there are those who recognize the depth of their knowledge, technological prowess, and contributions to the greater community. The Undead of Eox often serve as ambassadors, negotiators, and skilled artisans, leveraging their unique insights and necrotechnological expertise for the betterment of the Pact Worlds.
