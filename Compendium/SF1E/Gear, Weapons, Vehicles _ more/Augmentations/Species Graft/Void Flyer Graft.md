# VOID FLYER GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 147_  
**Item Level** 4; **Price** 2,000; **System** Lung and Spinal Column  
Sarcesians are adapted to surviving in a vacuum as they fly among asteroids. This augmentation allows you to go 1 hour per day without breathing while also ignoring the harmful effects of a vacuum. When in a vacuum, you automatically grow wings made from pure energy, granting you a supernatural fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.
