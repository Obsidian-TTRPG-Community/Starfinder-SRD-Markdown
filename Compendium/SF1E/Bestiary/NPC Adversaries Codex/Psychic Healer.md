# PSYCHIC HEALER
In many societies, practicing medicine requires extensive (and often formal) education and even certification. Yet the galaxy is a big, dangerous place, and some of the best healers are self-taught, work outside of official networks, or both. Altruism, prestige, or profit motivate most medics to provide life-saving care. However, medics can be villains, with criminals, charlatans, and unethical innovators willing to provide risky surgeries, experimental drugs, or cure-all placebos for the right price.

## DESCRIPTION

Psychic healers use magic to unravel curses, banish malevolent spirits, and burn away diseases. These miraculous remedies can make psychic healers into self-serving celebrities or cult leaders. Others are hermits or iconoclasts who disdain social obligations and demand potential clients prove their worth.
