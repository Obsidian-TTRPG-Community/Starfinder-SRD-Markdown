# Regimental Dress

Regimental dress is the light armor counterpart to ceremonial plate. Often stylized to the extreme, regimental dress comes in as many variations as there are military forces, militias, and private security details. Regimental dress uses advanced fibers and strategically placed ceramic plates to avoid ruining the design lines of the uniforms. A force field projector concealed in the collar activates as needed to provide life support and protection for the head. Integrated holographic imaging projects rank insignia, medals, and ribbons, and supports gesture-activated informational displays for each honor.
