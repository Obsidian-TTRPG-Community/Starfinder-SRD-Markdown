### Special Abilities

**Dermacrystal Coating (Ex)** The body and engine system of the sandrail is coated with a composite of microfine crystals and sand, forming a hard glassy barrier that allows it to skim across a desert as though it was flat terrain instead of difficult or rough terrain.  
**Long Jump Booster (Ex)** Once per day, the pilot can take a standard action to use the sandrail’s long jump booster, propelling the vehicle up to 20 ft. vertically and up to its full speed horizontally.

### Description

The combat sandrail skims over fine dust and sand, powered by a dynamic rear engine and a set of twin propulsion fans. Its lack of wheels and tubular roll cage keep the vehicle ultralight, and a passenger can fire from a small platform set on top of the engine.
