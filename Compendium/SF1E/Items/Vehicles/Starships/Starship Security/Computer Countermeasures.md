**PCU**:: —  
When a foe attempts to hack a starship’s computers and fails, a set of countermeasures can punish the would-be hacker. The crew can install one of the countermeasures listed on page 216, following the normal rules for countermeasures. Each countermeasure costs a number of Build Points equal to the starship’s computer’s tier (half the starship’s tier
see page 297).
