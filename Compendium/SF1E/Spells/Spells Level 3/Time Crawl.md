## Description

You distort time in the area, forcing it to pass slowly. This area is difficult terrain. Creatures in the area when the spell is cast, or who enter the area, are staggered for as long as they remain in the area. A creature that succeeds at a Fortitude saving throw negates the staggered condition and instead has all their speeds reduced by 10 feet for as long as they remain in the area. Creatures use the result of their initial saving throw against this spell, no matter how many times they leave and reenter the area.
