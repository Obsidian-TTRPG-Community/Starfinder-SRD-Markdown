## DESCRIPTION

You create a nonmagical, nontechnological, unattended object of nonliving matter. The volume of the item created can’t exceed 1 cubic foot (or 1 bulk) per caster level. You must succeed at an appropriate Engineering or Profession check to make a complex item, and you can’t create a consumable item.

**4th**: When you cast creation as a 4th-level spell, it creates an object made out of vegetable matter (such as wood) that has an item level no greater than one-third your caster level. The duration is 1 hour per caster level.

**5th**: When you cast creation as a 5th-level spell, it creates an object made out of vegetable matter or material of a mineral nature: crystal, metal, stone, or the like. The object can’t have an item level greater than half your caster level. The duration depends on the hardness and rarity of the created object, as indicated on the following table.

<table><tbody><tr><td><b>Hardness and Rarity Examples</b></td><td><b>Duration</b></td></tr><tr><td>Vegetable matter</td><td>2 hours/level</td></tr><tr><td>Stone, crystal, base metals</td><td>1 hour/level</td></tr><tr><td>Precious metals</td><td>20 minutes/level</td></tr><tr><td>Gems</td><td>10 minutes/level</td></tr><tr><td>Rare metals*</td><td>1 round/level</td></tr></tbody></table>

\* Includes adamantine, alchemical silver, mithral, and starmetal alloys. You can’t use a 5th-level _creation_ spell to create a cold iron item.
