## Description

You create an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect to create this sensor in a specific spot within range, but the locale must be either a place that’s familiar to you or an obvious location, such as inside a cave whose entrance you can see.

The sensor doesn’t move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. This spell functions only on the plane of existence you are currently occupying.
