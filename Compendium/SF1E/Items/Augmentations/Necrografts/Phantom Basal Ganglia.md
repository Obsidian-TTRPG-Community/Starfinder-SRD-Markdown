# Phantom Basal Ganglia

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 96_  

**System**:: Brain  
A phantom basal ganglia merges the shattered essence of a restless spirit with a living brain. The resulting mind is able to resist mental influence and control. You add the necrograft’s mark as a bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects.  
  
A phantom basal ganglia of mk 3 or higher gives a chance of shaking off mind-affecting effects. One round after failing a saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, or if the effect has any partial effect even with a successful save, you can attempt a new save against the same DC (this takes no action). If you succeed, the effect is removed entirely. If the mind-affecting effect already allows a second saving throw, you receive only one additional saving throw on the following round.
