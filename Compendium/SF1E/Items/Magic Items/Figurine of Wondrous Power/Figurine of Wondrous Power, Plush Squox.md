# Figurine of Wondrous Power, Plush Squox

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 49_
**Level**:: 3
**Price**::  1500 
**Bulk**:: L

### Description

This stuffed toy can turn into a trained squox (Alien Archive 2 118). Unlike most figurines of wondrous power, the figurine can transform into a squox for a total of 10 minutes per day, though the duration need not be used continuously and is expended in 1-minute increments. Wounds and damage received by the squox in its animate form translate to its figurine form when it reverts if it dies, the plush figure appears torn and without stuffing. The plush squox does not heal in 24 hours as usual—you must repair the figurine using Engineering or an appropriate profession.
