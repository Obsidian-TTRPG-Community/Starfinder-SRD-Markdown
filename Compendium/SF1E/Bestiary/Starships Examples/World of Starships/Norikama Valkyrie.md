## Description

Tired of being snubbed and dismissed by elites within the Veskarium, Norikama Syndicate recently launched a starship entirely of its own design: the Valkyrie. A capable battleship with deadly armaments; a bronze-tinted armored hull; and a sophisticated blue, white, and black interior, the Valkyrie is a sleek, stylish ship capable of holding its own on a battlefield. Designed to bring respect and legitimacy to Norikama and silence dismissive rumors regarding the company’s reputation for manufacturing shoddy knock-offs, the Valkyrie is making a splash throughout the Pact Worlds. Immediately adopted by peace-keeping organizations, mercenary groups, and organized crime syndicates, the Valkyrie has been touted as a masterpiece of fusion design, combining the best features of various cultures and styles in a way that’s fresh, bold, and forward-thinking.  
  
Unfortunately, its reception within the Veskarium has been decidedly cool. With the government, military, and many corporations unwilling to take a gamble on a Norikama ship, no matter the affordability, Norikama Syndicate’s hopes of Veskarium esteem and redemption have effectively been dashed.  
  
Determined to prove the Valkyrie capable of competing with battle-hardened ships, Norikama challenged a popular vesk mercenary outfit and loyal BMC customer, Darivor Corps, to use the Valkyrie in its combat operations for 6 months. Darivor Corps’ test runs proved the Valkyrie’s capabilities, improving Norikama’s public image within the Veskarium. However, a smear campaign just as quickly turned the tide when an anonymous source accused Norikama of stealing the starship plans from more respectable designers via corporate espionage and even outright murder. Although Norikama has refuted the claims and denounced them as outrageous lies, the citizens of the Veskarium at large seem to believe the salacious rumors. Despite the poor press, Darivor Corps has adopted the Valkyrie as its new flagship, leading other mercenary outfits, rebel groups, and budget-conscious police forces to take a gamble on the Valkyrie.
