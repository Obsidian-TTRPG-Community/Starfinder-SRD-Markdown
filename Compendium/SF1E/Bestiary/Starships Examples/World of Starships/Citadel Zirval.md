## Description

Those who broadcast propaganda that incites rebellion attract the Hellknight Order of the Eclipse, which has dedicated itself to quashing destabilizing messages in an environment of limitless communication. Hellknights aboard smaller vessels can, when orbiting over a communications center, scramble the Drift correspondence of satellites and even large settlements. But when a metropolis, space station, or entire nation is complicit in spreading chaos, Citadel Zirval itself might arrive, blocking out the system’s star- and radio-waves alike with its miles-wide bulk.  
  
Citadel Zirval was designed in the haunting aesthetic of an ancient Hellknight fortress, with thousands of rooms, hallways, training facilities, interrogation chambers, and more. At any time, it sustains 5,000 or more armigers in training, plus unknown thousands of Hellknights ready to deploy across the galaxy.  
  
The current Citadel Zirval is new, rebuilt after the Swarm destroyed it during the Battle of Stalendre-2. The Hellknight operation disrupted the Swarm’s telepathic coordination, allowing a Veskarium fleet to devastate that force, but the citadel fell to a counterattack. This second Citadel Zirval has operated for 12 years since, and thanks to its predecessor’s sacrifice and the Hellknights’ ongoing assistance in quashing dissent, the Order of the Eclipse enjoys impunity and outright welcome in much of Veskarium space.  

## Special Abilities

**Orbital EMP** Citadel Zirval maintains an extraordinary EMP weapon that can blast a 3-mile radius from high orbit as though it were a capital-class orbital weapon. This disables lights, non-analog technological equipment, and computers that are tier 4 and lower, though not larger defenses or starships. The effect also dampens communications infrastructure, limiting their maximum range to 3 miles. The effect lasts for 1d3 hours.
