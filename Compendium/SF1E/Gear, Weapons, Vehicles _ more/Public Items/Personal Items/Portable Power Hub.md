### DESCRIPTION

This blocky charging device with four adapter cables can store a single battery of any capacity, allowing up to four connected devices to drain charges from the stored battery to recharge their own batteries. A connected device can transfer 1 charge per minute from the stored battery to the device’s battery, though a stored battery can recharge only devices whose batteries’ maximum capacity is equal to or lower than that of the stored battery. The adapters are unsuitable for military application and cannot be used to recharge weapons.
