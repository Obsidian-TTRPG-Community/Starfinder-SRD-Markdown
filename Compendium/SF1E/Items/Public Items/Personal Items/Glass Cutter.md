This tool consists of a tiny blade at the end of a short arm that is attached to the center of an adhesive disc. When the disk is attached to a smooth surface such as a glass window or panel, you can spin the blade-tipped arm in a circle around the disk to quietly cut a 1-foot-diameter circle out of the glass. More advanced models with adamantine-diamond alloy blades can cut through surfaces even harder than glass. The type of material a glass cutter can cut through depends on its model, as described below.
