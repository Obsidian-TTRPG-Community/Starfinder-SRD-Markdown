### DESCRIPTION

Immediately after ingesting this jelly, your body becomes semi‑fluid. For 10 minutes, you gain the amorphous and compression universal creature rules. Most users find this experience wildly disorienting. For the serum’s duration, your speed is halved and you gain the flat-footed condition. As a standard action, you can attempt a DC 15 Fortitude save, ending the serum’s effects early if you succeed.
