**Casting-Time**:: 1 standard action

## Description

You forge a telepathic bond between yourself and a number of willing creatures, each of which must have an Intelligence score of 3 or higher (or a modifier of â€“4 or higher). Each creature included in the link is linked to all the others. The creatures can communicate telepathically through the bond regardless of language. No special power or influence is established as a result of the bond. Once the bond is formed, it works over any distance (although not from one plane to another).

If desired, you can leave yourself out of the telepathic bond forged. This decision must be made at the time of casting.
