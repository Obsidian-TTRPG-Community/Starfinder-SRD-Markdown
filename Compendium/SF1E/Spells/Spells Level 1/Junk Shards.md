## DESCRIPTION

You summon sharp fragments of technological junk that fly toward your target and deal 3d6 piercing and slashing damage. The spell leaves behind 1 bulk of junked electronic equipment in the target creatureâ€™s space that is suitable for targeting with spells such as _battle junkbot_, _handy junkbot_, _healing junkbot_, _junk armor_, _junk restraints_, or _junksword_. The junked electronics have no resale value and cannot be repaired into any functioning item. A creature trained in Engineering or Physical Science can reveal the useless nature of the junk by directly examining it.
