## Description

Similar to _augury_ but more powerful, a _divination_ spell can provide you with a useful piece of advice in reply to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. Casting this spell requires you to expend 1 Resolve Point. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If you donâ€™t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The chance for a correct divination is 75%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.

As with _augury_, multiple castings of _divination_ about the same topic by the same caster use the same die result as the first _divination_ spell and yield the same answer each time.
