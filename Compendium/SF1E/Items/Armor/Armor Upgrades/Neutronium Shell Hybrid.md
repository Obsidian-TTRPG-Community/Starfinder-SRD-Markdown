# Neutronium Shell (HYBRID)

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 43_

A suit of heavy or powered armor can be sprayed with a thin coat of magically stabilized neutronium. It takes an hour to apply a neutronium shell, and 8 hours of work to remove one. The armor grants electricity resistance 10 and resistance 15 against damage done by laser weapons or other light-based attacks (this doesn’t stack with any other resistances that would reduce similar damage, such as fire resistance).
