# Mech Weapons

Engineers have designed and adapted a wide range of weapons for mechs to use. Each weapon combines two factors—the weapon’s level and a weapon template—to determine its statistics and MP cost. Mech weapons use many of the same rules as standard weapons (Core Rulebook 168), including damage types, targeting Armor Class, damage, range, critical hits, capacity, usage, and weapon special properties.  
Mech weapons also use the following key statistics.  
**
**Weapon Template:** Each weapon uses a weapon template that determines the weapon’s basic shape and functions, such as a laser cannon or sword. A weapon template modifies some combination of the weapon’s statistics, such as damage, damage type, range, and special weapon properties.  
**Damage:** Each weapon deals low, medium, high, or extreme damage based on the weapon’s level when it successfully hits a target; see Table 4–5: Weapon Damage on page 104 for the damage dealt by weapons of a given level. A mech also adds its tier to the damage dealt by weapons it wields, and a mech adds its Strength modifier to its damage with melee weapons.  
**Slots:** These are the number and types of slots that a mech must devote to equipping and wielding the weapon. Slot types include frame, lower limb, and upper limb.  
**Capacity:** This is the number of attacks a mech can perform with the weapon before needing to reload as a move action. Each mech can carry two additional sets of ammunition, unless it has one or more ammo reserve auxiliary systems.  
**Power Point:** Many weapons have a special ability that the mech can only perform by expending one or more Power Points; the number of PP used is listed in parentheses.  
**Cost:** This is the cost of the weapon in MP. Each weapon’s cost is based on the weapon’s level.

Each time a mech reloads its grenade launcher, it loads any combination of 3 grenades it currently has available. For example, a mech with an 8th-level grenade launcher could carry five mk 3 frag grenades (level 8) and four mk 2 cryo grenades (level 10), loading any combination of three grenades each time it reloads.
