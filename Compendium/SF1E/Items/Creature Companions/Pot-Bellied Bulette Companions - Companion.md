#  POT-BELLIED BULETTE COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 73_  
New Horizons Luxury Retreats’ genetic engineers have reached back into the mists of lost Golarion’s past to recreate one of that planet’s most feared predators... in miniature form! By shrinking the original creature’s size and dampening its voracious appetite, these scientists have essentially domesticated the bulette. The tiny, pot-bellied versions of these landsharks retain their iconic dorsal fin and ability to burrow through the earth.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Leaping Charge (Ex)** As a full action, a pot-bellied bulette can jump, and if it enters an opponent’s space at the end of a horizontal jump or the apex of a vertical jump, it can make a melee attack.  
If the pot-bellied bulette jumps at least 20 feet horizontally or 5 feet vertically, it can make two melee attacks instead of one (with the standard –4 penalty to each attack). The pot-bellied bulette gains a +4 bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity for entering or leaving an opponent’s space during this action.
