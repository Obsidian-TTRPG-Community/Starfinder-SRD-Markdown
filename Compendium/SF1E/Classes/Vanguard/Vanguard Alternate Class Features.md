# Vanguard Alternate Class Features

# Entropic Shot (SU)

**Source**:: Tech Revolution pg. 36
**Class** Vanguard

You can deliver your entropic strike with any small arm as though you were delivering an entropic strike with a melee weapon. You must treat the entropic strike as being made of the ammunition’s material (if any). Also, you must apply the small arm’s weapon special properties, critical hit effect, and weapon fusions to the entropic strike, so long as the effects could be applied to a small arm that deals acid or bludgeoning damage, and that doesn’t require information beyond that specified for your entropic strike to function. If the weapon special property, critical hit effect, or weapon fusion requires information provided for your weapon (such as the amount of a bleed critical hit effect), use the value for the weapon you’re gaining the effect from. You don’t add your Strength or Constitution modifier to your entropic strike’s damage when delivered through a small arm, and your weapon specialization adds only half your level to entropic strikes you deliver with a small arm. If the small arm is used to affect an area (such as with the blast or line weapon special property), the entropic strike delivered with that weapon deals 1 less damage per damage die.
When you gain entropic attunement at 5th level, add the weapon properties first arc (dealing acid damage instead of electricity damage) and guided to those you can add to your entropic strike, and remove the weapon properties feint and force. At 10th level, you don’t increase your entropic strike’s reach. Instead, when channeling your entropic strike through a small arms weapon, increase the weapon’s range increment by 5 feet, plus an additional 5 feet at 13th, 16th, and 19th level. At 16th level, when you gain the ability to channel your entropic strike to deal damage to an area, you can only channel the attack through a small arm you’re wielding; instead of attacking all targets within 20 feet of you, you make a ranged attack against all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst with a range equal to your small arm’s range increment.
Entropic shot modifies entropic strike, entropic attunement, and weapon specialization.

# Mututal Destruction (SU)

SFS Note: The Mutual Destruction Alternate Class Feature for Vanguards replaces Invulnerability, and alters Entropic Pool and Mitigate.
**Source**:: Galactic Magic pg. 36
**Class** Vanguard

You forgo many defensive capabilities to ensure your enemies’ obliteration. Your entropic pool no longer grants you a bonus to Armor Class. Instead, as long as you have at least 1 Entropy Point in your entropic pool, you can reroll any one damage die dealt by each of your entropic strikes, using the second result. The number of dice you can reroll increases by 1 at 8th level and every 3 levels thereafter (maximum 6 dice at 20th level). If you have no Stamina Points when you reroll a die in this way, you can roll 1d8 instead of 1d6 (or 1d6 instead of either 1d3 or 1d4).
When you spend EP as a move action to boost the damage of your next entropic strike attack, your entropic strike deals +1d6 damage for every EP expended, rather than +1d4 damage. When you do so, you take damage equal to the number of EP you spent.
At 2nd level, whenever you take damage from a creature within 30 feet of you, you can spend 1 Entropy Point to deal an amount of damage equal to your vanguard level to that creature. This damage must be a type of damage (or combination of damage types) that your entropic strike can deal. You can’t use the mitigate ability to reduce damage you take, but you retain the ability to remove your DR, energy resistance, and granted AC bonuses. In addition, as a reaction when you’re affected by an ability that would restore your Hit Points or Stamina Points, you can reduce the Hit Points or Stamina Points restored by any amount; as long as you reduce it by an amount equal to at least 3 + your vanguard level, you gain 1 EP.
At 20th level, you can spend a swift action to reduce the DR and energy resistances of yourself and all enemies in a 60-foot spread centered on you by 20 (minimum 0). This causes you to gain Entropy Points swiftly, gaining one additional EP from any effect that would grant you EP, and when you reroll any entropic strike damage die, you can roll 1d12 instead of 1d6. Finally, you can take 3 reactions each round. These benefits last for 1 minute. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate this ability as part of a full attack rather than as a swift action.
