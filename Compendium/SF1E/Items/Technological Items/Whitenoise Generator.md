### Description

This small box produces random signals across multiple auditory and subauditory spectra. An activated white-noise generator increases the DC of sound-based Perception checks by 4 within 100 feet of the device. This increase is reduced by 1 for each additional 100 feet. The increase is doubled for checks that rely on technological listening, such as with a drone or microphone.
