### Description

A _mantle of willpower_ is a garment that covers the shoulders, sometimes with a hood and sometimes including a longer cape. High-ranking members of the Knights of Golarion and the Stewards have been known to wear such mantles, as they help keep you calm and in control of your faculties.  
  
While wearing this mantle, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects. In addition, as a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to end all mind-affecting effects you are currently suffering from. If a mind-affecting effect renders you unable to take or determine your actions, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to end all mind-affecting effects you are currently suffering at the start of your turn, but you are then stunned until the start of your next turn. You can spend up to 2 Resolve Points per day to activate the mantle’s abilities. Once you spend any Resolve Points using a given _mantle of willpower_, that mantle won’t work for anyone else for 24 hours and you can’t use a different one for 24 hours.
