### DESCRIPTION

When it detonates, a wonder grenade releases a locus of magical uncertainty, which explodes into a strange effect once it makes contact with reality. When the grenade detonates, roll d% on the following table to determine the effect. (The GM is free to make up a similar effect based on your surroundings and circumstances.) If any effect of the grenade allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + your key ability score modifier.

These grenades pose a risk to the thrower. If you roll a 1, 3, or 5 on the attack roll, when the grenade lands but before it goes off, you teleport into the nearest open space in the blast radius. If no such space exists, you don’t teleport.

| D%     | Wonder Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| 1–5    | Each creature in the blast radius switches positions with another randomly determined creature in the blast radius (no save). No creature is placed in an area that is immediately hazardous to it (instead appearing in the closest safe space).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 6–10   | Unlocked airlocks, appliance doors, doors, gates, lids, and windows open in the blast radius. Locks unlock if they are average or worse or controlled by a computer of tier 3 or lower. Magical locks that would open from a knock spell with a caster level check result of 25 or lower also unlock. After the blast unlocks a lock, whatever the lock was sealing opens. A creature can negate this effect on all objects it holds or wears with a successful Will saving throw.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 11–15  | The blast radius becomes an area of zero gravity (Core Rulebook 404) for 4d4 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 16–20  | The blast radius becomes the area of an explosive blast spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 21–25  | Each creature in the blast radius must attempt a Reflex saving throw. Those that fail enter a state of reduced friction, which functions as if all surfaces they move on and all objects they hold are affected by a grease spell.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 26–30  | Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or its powered technological items cease to function for 1 round. A technological construct that fails the save is also staggered for 1 round. Unattended technological objects receive no saving throw and simply cease to function for 1 round.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 31–35  | Each creature in the blast radius is affected as if by the ethereal jaunt spell for 1d4 rounds (no save).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 36–40  | Each creature in the blast radius is affected as if by the invisibility spell for 4d4 rounds (no save).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 41–45  | Thousands of UPBs erupt in the blast radius, dealing 3d6 bludgeoning damage to each creature in the area (Reflex half). All but 1d4 × 10 UPBs are blown out of the blast radius, disappearing as they go.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 46–50  | Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or sprout 2d4 armlike appendages. Some of these arms lack anatomy consistent with their host. Only two are useful, like a kasatha’s extra arms. These limbs remain for 4d6 hours, but can also be removed with remove affliction (DC 20).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 51–55  | One First World beast is teleported into the blast radius. Roll d% to determine the beast: 1–15—Huge beast (such as an elephant); 16–50—Large beast (such as a rhino); 51–100—Tiny beast (such as a squirrel). The beast appears in an unoccupied space, only 1 square of which must be in the blast radius. If the beast doesn’t have enough room to appear, a beast of the next smaller size appears. The beast is no one’s ally. It has a 25% chance to arrive hostile, but is otherwise indifferent until it reacts to the current situation. Use the summoning creatures rules (Alien Archive 244) to determine the creature’s statistics.                                                                                           |
| 56–60  | Each creature in the blast radius can hear the surface thoughts of other creatures within 30 feet of it as a bewildering jumble alongside its own. This mind-affecting effect renders a creature shaken. A creature can attempt a Will save at the end of its turn each round to end the effect. Otherwise, the effect lasts 1 minute. If a creature succeeds at its saving throw by 5 or more, that creature is no longer shaken and can focus the effect to function as detect thoughts, lasting for the remainder of the effect’s duration.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 61–65  | Each creature in the blast radius must succeed at a Will saving throw or suffer the mind-affecting delusion that it has increased one step in size. An affected creature takes a –1 circumstance penalty to Dexterity-based checks and saving throws, as well as to EAC and KAC. It is treated as squeezing when a creature of its imagined size would be squeezing, and it is unlikely to attempt to move into areas “too small” for it. If a creature believes it is constrained completely, it becomes paralyzed. This delusion lasts 2d4 rounds, but the creature can attempt a new saving throw once on any round when something happens that contradicts the false belief, such as being moved when it believes itself constrained. |
| 66–70  | About 5,000 harmless, beautiful flying insects appear within the blast radius. This swarm functions like a fog cloud spell that disperses after 4d4 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 71–75  | The center of the blast radius becomes a gravitational anomaly for an instant. Creatures in the blast radius must succeed at a Fortitude save or be dragged to the enarest space adjacent to the grenade’s point of detonation. Any creature that collides with terrain that blocks line of effect or with another creature takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage and falls prone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 76–80  | The grenade splits into 1d3+1 grenades, each of a kind determined randomly by rolling d%: 1–20—frag II, 21–34—screamer II, 35–50— shock II, 51–70—stickybomb II, 71–80—cryo I, 81–90—flash II, 91–100—incendiary II. Each grenade bounces as if its thrower had missed when throwing it. After each grenade lands at its new target, it detonates.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| 81–85  | About a thousand adorable, harmless Diminutive animals appear in the blast radius, covering the ground. This horde makes the blast radius difficult terrain, and at the end of every round, that area expands by 5 feet. Any item dropped or thrown into the area is knocked 1d4 squares in a random direction by the scrambling creatures, and knocked again when the area expands. The horde expands enough to disperse after 5 rounds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 86–90  | For 4d4 rounds, the blast radius fills with a windstorm (Core Rulebook 400).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 91–95  | Each creature in the blast radius changes color to a random neon hue (no save). Roll 1d6: 1 red, 2 orange, 3 yellow, 4 green, 5 blue, or 6 violet. This effect is permanent but can be ended with a successful casting of remove affliction (DC 20), but if the spell fails, the target changes color again.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 96–100 | The blast radius becomes a globe of vacuum (Core Rulebook 394), subjecting creatures initially caught in it to decompression. Air outside the vacuum rushes in to fill it after 4d4 minutes, unless the vacuum completely fills a sealed area, in which case it remains a vacuum even after 4d4 minutes have passed until the area is unsealed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
