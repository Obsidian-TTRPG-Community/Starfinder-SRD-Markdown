# Electrified Hull

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 82_
**Price**:: 75000  
**CHARGES**:: 40
**USAGE**:: 5/round  
  
Powerful circuits installed along the vehicle’s exterior electrocute enemies, leaving the vehicle’s inhabitants unharmed. An electrified hull can be activated as a move action. While active, creatures and vehicles that touch the vehicle’s exterior—including vehicles engaged with the modified vehicle and any action that deals collision damage—take 1d10 electricity damage. Creatures damaged by the electrified hull are staggered for 1 round unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = this vehicle’s collision DC). A vehicle damaged by the electrified hull (even if the damage didn’t overcome the vehicle’s hardness) takes a –2 penalty to its Piloting modifier.
