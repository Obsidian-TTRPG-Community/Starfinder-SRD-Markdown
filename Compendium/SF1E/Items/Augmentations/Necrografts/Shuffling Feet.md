# Shuffling Feet

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 73_  

**System**:: All Feet  
By replacing your feet with those of a zombie or other slow‑moving undead creature, you can move at a deliberate and unpredictable pace that confuses combatants and dampens your footfalls to a lulling susurrus. You can activate shuffling feet when you move while hiding to gain a circumstance bonus to your Stealth checks to remain hidden until the end of your turn. This bonus equals the necrograft’s mark.  
Alternatively, you can activate shuffling feet when you take a guarded step to increase the distance you move. You can move 10 feet with a guarded step with mk 1 or mk 2 shuffling feet, 15 feet with mk 3 shuffling feet, 20 feet with mk shuffling feet, or up to your speed with mk 5 shuffling feet.  
After you activate either use of your shuffling feet, you cannot activate them again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.
