# Extradimensional Storage

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 82_
**Price** 50,000  
The vehicle contains a hatch (interior or exterior) that opens seemingly onto a solid wall, unless a button is pressed first (this is a move action) to open the hatch into an extradimensional space similar to that of a null-space chamber. The extradimensional space holds up to 100 bulk in a 9-foot cube. The extradimensional storage can’t be closed if more than the listed bulk is inside.
