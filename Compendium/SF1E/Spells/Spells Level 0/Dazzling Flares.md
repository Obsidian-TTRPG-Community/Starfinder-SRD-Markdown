## Description

You evoke fist-sized pockets of existence from multiple realities, creating chemical reactions that result in up to a dozen flares. These flares appear at once, and they do so within a 10-foot-radius spread. You choose the flares’ colors, including colorless, and they make popping noises as they flicker in and out of reality. This popping can be as quiet as a human’s whisper or as loud as up to 20 humans shouting. You can cause the flares to emit a sulfurous or ozone smell as they pop. These distracting flares impose a –2 penalty on Perception checks attempted in the area.  
If you cast this spell while another casting of _dazzling flares_ is still in effect, the previous casting ends.
