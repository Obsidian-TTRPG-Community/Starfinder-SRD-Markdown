# Transplanar Gluon Blade

Occasionally, abductees manage to escape from grays with a transplanar gluon blade. It resembles a standard box cutter consisting of a plump, hard plastic handle with a short blade that extends out the top while depressing a button, retracted rapidly by a simple spring. Once per day, you can spend 1 minute concentrating with the blade to subtly work it between the seams of reality and cut open a portal to its linked transitive plane. A transplanar gluon blade doesn’t function if not on the Material Plane or its linked transitive plane. Portals created with the blade close after 1d4 rounds.
