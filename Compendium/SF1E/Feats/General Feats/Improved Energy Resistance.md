# Improved Energy Resistance

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 116_  
Your natural resistance to an energy type is more pronounced.

**Prerequisites**: Con 13, character level 10th, energy resistance from a racial trait.

**Benefit**: Your resistance to one type of energy damage from a racial trait stacks with one other source of energy resistance. If it already stacked, that resistance increases by 5 instead.

**Special**: You can take this feat multiple times—its effects don’t stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different energy resistance from a racial trait.
