### Description

The label of this tart, yellow beverage features a cartoon armored knight holding a tower shield with a lemon emblazoned across it. Its slogan reads, “Your knight in citrus armor.” The serum grants you a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of chaotic outsiders.
