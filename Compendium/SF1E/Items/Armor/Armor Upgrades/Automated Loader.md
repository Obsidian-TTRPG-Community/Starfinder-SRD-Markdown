# Automated Loader

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 205_  
**Level**:: 2
**Price**::  750  
**Slots** 1 **Armor Type** Powered 
**Bulk**:: 1  
This device attaches to powered armor and consists of a small robotic arm and a storage compartment that holds up to 2 bulk of ammunition and batteries. You can activate the automated loader as a move action to reload or recharge a weapon that’s mounted to the powered armor (but not to replace the batteries of the powered armor itself). Abilities that let you reload faster than a move action don’t apply to an automated loader.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in powered armor.
