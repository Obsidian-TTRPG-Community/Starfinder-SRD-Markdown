You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you are hit by an attack that deals acid, electricity, or fire damage to direct part of that energy toward a foe within 15 feet of you. Make a special ranged attack against them that does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If you hit, your attack deals damage equal to either half the original attack’s damage or double your soldier level, whichever is less. This damage’s type or types match those of the original attack.
