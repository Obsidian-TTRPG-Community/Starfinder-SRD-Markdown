# Overland Travel

Characters covering long distances cross-country use overland movement. Overland movement is measured in miles per hour or miles per day. A day represents 8 hours of actual travel time when traveling on foot or on a mount. Vehicles with a single pilot or a very small crew can travel for about 10 hours in a day. Large vehicles that operate continuously with a large crew on multiple shifts can travel continuously for 24 hours.

# Terrain

The terrain through which you travel affects the distance you can cover while traveling. The table below shows you how to modify travel times based on the type of terrain and the quality of the path you’re following. A highway is a major, mostly straight, paved road. A road is typically a dirt track. A trail is like a road, except that it allows only single-file travel and does not benefit a party traveling with vehicles. Trackless terrain is a wild area with no paths.  
  

| Terrain                   | Highway | Road or Trail | Trackless |
|---------------------------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Desert (all temperatures) | ×1      | ×1/2          | ×1/2      |
| Forest (typical)          | ×1      | ×1            | ×1/2      |
| Forest (dense)            | ×1      | ×3/4          | ×1/4      |
| Hill                      | ×1      | ×3/4          | ×1/2      |
| Marsh                     | ×1      | ×3/4          | ×1/2      |
| Mountain                  | ×3/4    | ×3/ 4         | ×1/2      |
| Plains                    | ×1      | ×1            | ×3/4      |

# Walk

You can walk for 8 hours during a day without a problem. Walking for longer than that can wear you out (see Forced March below).

# Hustle

You can hustle for 1 hour without a problem. Hustling for a second hour in between sleep cycles deals 1 nonlethal damage to you, and each additional hour deals twice the damage taken during the previous hour of hustling. If you take any nonlethal damage from hustling, you become fatigued (see page 276). When you recover from this nonlethal damage, you also eliminate the fatigued condition.

# Run

You can’t run overland for an extended period of time. Attempts to run and rest in cycles effectively work out to a hustle.

# Forced March

In a day of normal walking, you walk for 8 hours, and then you spend the rest of your daylight time making and breaking camp, resting, and eating. However, you can walk for more than 8 hours in a day by making a forced march. For each hour of marching beyond 8 hours, you must succeed at a Constitution check (DC = 10 + 2 per extra hour) or you take 1d6 nonlethal damage. If you take any nonlethal damage from a forced march, you become fatigued (see page 276). When you recover from this nonlethal damage, you also eliminate the fatigued condition. Still, it’s quite possible to march yourself into unconsciousness by pushing yourself too hard.
