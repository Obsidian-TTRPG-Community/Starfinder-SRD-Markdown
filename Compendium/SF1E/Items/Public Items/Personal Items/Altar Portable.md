### Description

Portable altars are designed for use by traveling or adventuring priests when access to a church or temple is not available. Portable altars can be made of durable plastic, ceramic, or even wood, and they are usually ornately decorated and embellished with the religious iconography of a particular deity or faith. One side of the altar is a hinged lid, allowing you to store items such as holy texts, religious symbols, and other religious accoutrements inside.
