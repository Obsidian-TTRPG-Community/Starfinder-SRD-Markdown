# MYSTERIOUS HERMIT
Survivalists are defined by independence and self-sufficiency. They often expertly navigate specific types of hostile or dangerous terrain: forests, deserts, or more remote locales such as dead space or post-apocalyptic cityscapes. Survivalists generally don’t rely on others and commonly live and work alone. However, the following statistics can represent hunters and warriors within a community as well as hermits. A survivalist might have some kind of sentient companion or a creature companion, such as a beast of burden or a hunting beast. A survivalist might arrive at a critical moment to help PCs as they travel through a barren wasteland. Alternatively, a survivalist makes an excellent antagonist in a wilderness setting since they’re capable of using every aspect of the environment against their foes.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Peer into the Unknown (Su)** A mysterious hermit can spend 1 Resolve Point to gain +2 on an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw. They can choose to use this ability after success or failure has been determined.  
**Weird Surroundings (Su)** A mysterious hermit has the ability to alter the terrain close to their home. In any location where the hermit has lived for at least 1 year, they can create one of the following effects within a radius of 1 mile: change the local gravity by 1 step, change the local temperature by 1 step, or increase Survival DCs to avoid getting lost by 10. A mysterious hermit can change which effect is active once per day and the change takes effect after 1 day.

## DESCRIPTION

For one reason or another, mysterious hermits isolate themselves from civilization. Perhaps a hermit chose isolation to better focus on their studies, or perhaps they fled their home after being persecuted for performing horrible experiments on the local populace. Locating a hermit and convincing them to share their knowledge requires seekers to travel to remote, dangerous locales simply for the chance of receiving a hermit’s aid. Hermits can have a range of reactions to others seeking them; they might be grateful for some brief company, or be violently distrustful of those who seek their knowledge.
