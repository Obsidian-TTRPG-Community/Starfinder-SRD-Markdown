# Charge Emitter

This series of insulating reinforced-glass rings can be installed into armor upgrade slots and focuses an electrical charge into a targeted bolt. The sheer power necessary to project a bolt of electricity means that even an impulse charge emitter is a substantial weapon, and jolt charge emitters and surge charge emitters are significantly more powerful. Their relatively slim profile makes them popular for a number of users, from androids and others who benefit from a racial armor upgrade slot, to starship-repair crews in hostile space who want to keep their hands free for their work without leaving themselves totally undefended.

### Shock Weapons

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weaponsâ€™ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
