Worshipers of Zon-Kuthon developed the first shadow chains using cutting-edge heat-transfer technology, but outsiders rapidly reverse-engineered the weapons, constructing functional facsimiles from their own tech. Shadow chainsâ€™ links rapidly absorb heat, while their heavily insulated handle protect their wielders from direct exposure to the freezing darkness. Many adherents of the Midnight Lord make use of the follower, acolyte, and penitent shadow chains, while only the most devout can afford the more powerful ecclesiastic and devotional shadow chains.

# Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
