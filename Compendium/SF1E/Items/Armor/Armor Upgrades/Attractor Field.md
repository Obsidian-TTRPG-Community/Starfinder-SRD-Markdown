This module employs a combination of magnetic fields and magical energies that cause melee weapons that strike you to get stuck. It must be installed in a suit of armor for 24-hours before it functions, and when the upgrade is removed from the armor, no other upgrade can use its vacated slot for a 24-hour cool-down period. When an enemy hits you with a melee weapon, as a reaction you can activate this upgrade, which grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to disarm combat maneuvers to disarm the enemy of that weapon before the beginning of the enemy’s next turn. An _attractor field’s_ charges replenish each day.
