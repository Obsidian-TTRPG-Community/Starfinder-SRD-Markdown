### DESCRIPTION

This simple glove is surprisingly smooth to the touch. While holding an item no larger than 2 bulk in the hand wearing it, you can command a _glove of storing_ to shrink the held item to microscopic size and negligible bulk, and merge it with the palm of the glove. Returning the item to its original scale requires a mere snap of the fingers wearing the glove. You can store or retrieve an item within a _glove of storing_ as a swift or move action. A _glove of storing_ can store only one item at a time, and if the glove’s effect is suppressed or dispelled, any stored item immediately returns to its original size.
