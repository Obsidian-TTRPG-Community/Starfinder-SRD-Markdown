### Description

These bright reflective ribbons tear easily and are backed by an all-weather adhesive, making it easy to mark a trail while on the move. If you apply these to your path, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to orienteer, and other creatures following your trail gain a +5 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to orienteer and follow your tracks. The ribbonâ€™s adhesive usually lasts for one month before losing strength. One roll of waymarker ribbon is typically sufficient to mark 20 miles of trail.
