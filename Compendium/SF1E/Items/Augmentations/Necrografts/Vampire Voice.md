# Vampire Voice

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 97_  
**System** Throat  
A vampire voice necrograft attaches to your vocal cords, granting a supernaturally threatening tone. While most recipients of vampire voices are convinced their necrografts came from vampire spawn, creators of these undead augmentations never promise any such lofty origins.  
  
A vampire voice grants an enhancement bonus to Intimidate checks equal to the necrograft’s mark. You can also use Intimidate to bully a creature without sharing a language. If you succeed at the check, you can convey a single simple request along with the bullying (such as “go away” or “don’t hurt him”), though specific or complex requests can’t be made without sharing a language. Once a creature has been the target of a bullying attempt by a recipient with a vampire voice, it can’t be targeted by this ability from the same recipient again for 24 hours.
