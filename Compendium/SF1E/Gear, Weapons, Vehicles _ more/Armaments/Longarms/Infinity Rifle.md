# INFINITY RIFLE

Infinity rifles take their name from their shape, two conjoined rings similar to an infinity symbol with twin muzzles along the outer edge of one ring. The two rings contain a twisted loop of fiber-optic cabling that channels the laser beam; adding more energy to the loop results in a more powerful blast. These weapons were first introduced to the Pact Worlds by skittermanders (Starfinder Alien Archive 106), though their current nomenclature (tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon) was imposed by other weapons manufacturers.

### LASER WEAPONS

Laser weapons emit highly focused beams of light that deal fire damage. These beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.

Laser weapons use various means to concentrate beams of light into deadly intensity. Some focus light through a faceted crystal, while others focus the beam through a chemical cloud or ionized gas.
