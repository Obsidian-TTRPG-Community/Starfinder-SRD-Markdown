# ILSKITT - COMPANIONS

Natives of Vesk-3, ilskitts look like brightly colored owls with weasel-like torsos. They love to steal and hoard objects, and they are known to bring their owners gifts of items they “find.”

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Distracting (Ex)** Ilskitts gain a +4 racial bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity for entering or leaving an opponent’s space. If your ilskitt is sharing an opponent’s space, that opponent takes a –2 penalty to Perception and Sense Motive checks.  
**Filch (Ex)** As a standard action, your ilskitt can attempt to steal an item that isn’t being wielded or worn from a creature within 60 feet of you using the pick pocket task of the Sleight of Hand skill. An ilskitt’s bonus to this check is 4 + the ilskitt’s level, or your Sleight of Hand bonus, whichever is higher. The target automatically succeeds at noticing the attempt.
