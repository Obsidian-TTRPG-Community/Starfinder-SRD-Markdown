### DESCRIPTION

Made by the kasatha, these suits of heavy armor are so named for their slitted helmets, which reveal only the eyes. A rebreather lets the wearer keep their faces completely covered. A ceramic breastplate, shoulder guards, bracers, and greaves protect the wearer while facilitating the graceful kasathan close-combat style.
