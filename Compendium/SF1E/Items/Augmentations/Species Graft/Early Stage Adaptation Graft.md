**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 143_  
**Level**:: 9
**Price**::  13000 
**System**:: All Arms and Skin  
Even the youngest barathus have control over their mutable bodies. A series of extendable plates, elastic filaments, and reflective layers are installed throughout your skin and arms to provide you similar benefits. Once every 1d4 rounds as a swift action, you can reshape part of your body and adjust your chemistry to gain one of the following qualities. The adaptation lasts until the beginning of your next turn.

-   You can add an additional amount of damage to melee attacks equal to your Strength modifier.
-   You gain a +1 enhancement bonus to AC.
-   You gain resistance 2 against a single energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic).
-   Your reach is extended by 5 feet.
