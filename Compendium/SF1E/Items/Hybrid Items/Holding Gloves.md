# Holding Gloves

_Holding gloves_ have copper mesh on the fingertips and forming a concavity on the palm. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. Once per day as a standard action while wearing the gloves, you can use their embedded spell as a spell-like ability. If you hit with a melee attack (including an unarmed strike), you can use the spell from the gloves as a reaction, targeting the same creature the attack hit, without provoking an attack of opportunity. After the first time you cast the spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cast it again, up to two more times on a given day. Once you use a given pair of _holding gloves_, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.  
  
The spell imbued in _holding gloves_ depends on their model, as follows.
