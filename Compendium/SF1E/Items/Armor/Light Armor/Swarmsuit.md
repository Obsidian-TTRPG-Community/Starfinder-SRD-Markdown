### Description

Inspired by Swarm technology and designed specifically for shirrens, a swarmsuit is a collection of ablative plates backed with reinforced padding and linked with mesh straps. The light armor’s unique arrangement makes it perfect for creatures with unusual physiologies. The wearer arranges the straps in a comfortable formation and slides the ablative plates to cover vulnerable areas.
