## Physician Drone

Level:: 10

## Description

This Small drone is designed to provide basic medical services and nursing. Resembling a mechanical spider with four gripping feet and four arms tipped with syringes, antiseptic applicators, and biogel dispensers, a physician drone usually perches above its patient’s bed and provides assistance from above. A physician drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the climbing claws and manipulator arms mods instead of the stealth drone’s normal initial mods, and it treats Medicine as a class skill in which it has a single rank. Its skill unit is Acrobatics, and it has an Intelligence of 8 rather than 6. A physician drone has 6 bulk.

An elite physician drone also has the medical subroutine mod, allowing it to provide emergency medical treatment.
