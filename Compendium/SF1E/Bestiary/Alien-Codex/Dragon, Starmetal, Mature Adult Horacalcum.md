## Mature Adult Horacalcum Dragon Cr 15

this takes no action, and the number of rounds by which the dragon can alter the duration is equal to one-fourth its CR (minimum 1). If the effect is on an unwilling target, that target can attempt a Will saving throw to negate this effect. A horacalcum dragon can shorten or extend one effect per turn, and it can affect a given effect only once.
Ancient myths assert that the first metallic dragons were created from metallic deposits. Draconic scholars hotly debate the merit of such tales, but less controversial is the existence of the rare creatures known as starmetal dragons. No one knows their origins, but they are most commonly found in especially remote areas of the galaxy.
Starmetal dragons look different than most other true dragons, with scales that reffect their particular namesakes.
