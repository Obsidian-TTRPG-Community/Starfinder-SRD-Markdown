### Description

Gulchguns are a feat of fearless ysoki tinkering; the rifles use scattergun shells as ammunition but detonate them entirely within the rifleâ€™s internal chambers, instead firing a tongue of flame, accompanied by tremendous noise. The technology of the gulchgun eventually developed into the shorter and more stable shellgun, but ysoki purists and desperate buyers alike keep the market for these weapons alive.
