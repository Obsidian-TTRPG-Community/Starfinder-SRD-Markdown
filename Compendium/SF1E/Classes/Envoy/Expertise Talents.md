# EXPERTISE TALENTS
You gain an expertise talent at 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter. With the exception of additional skill expertise, these talents require you to have expertise in the skills they affect, as indicated in parentheses after the talent’s name.


##  ADDITIONAL SKILL EXPERTISE(EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_
Choose another skill in which you have at least 1 rank from the list of skills you can choose with the expertise class feature; you can use expertise with that skill. You can choose this talent up to three times, choosing a different skill each time.

##   ALTERED BEARING (EX; DISGUISE)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_
You can quickly adjust your posture, your stride, your demeanor, and the way your clothes and gear fit, causing casual observers to fail to recognize your true appearance. When you attempt a Disguise check to alter minor details of your appearance, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a move action. You don’t reduce the DC by 5 for attempting to alter only minor details, and if an observer succeeds at an opposed Perception check that pierces your disguise, he also realizes your true race and what features you have disguised. You can’t use this ability for more complex disguises.

##   ANALYST (EX; SENSE MOTIVE)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_
You have been taught to carefully consider your own assumptions, making it much less likely you assign false motives to other creatures. When using Sense Motive to detect deception or discern a secret message, as long as your expertise die roll result is not a 1, you don’t think a truthful statement contains deceptions or infer false information from a secret message even if you fail your check by 5 or more.

##   BAD IDEA (EX; INTIMIDATE)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 22_
With a few quick words and menacing body language, you can make a foe reconsider starting a fight. When you roll initiative, make an Intimidate check against one creature you’re aware of within 30 feet. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Intimidate skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater; if the creature has a special bonus to saving throws against fear effects, it adds this bonus to the DC. If you succeed, roll your expertise die and apply the result as a penalty to that creature’s initiative result. Once you use this expertise talent, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

##   BATTLEFIELD MEDIC (EX; MEDICINE)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_
When you attempt a Medicine check to stop bleed damage or administer first aid to a dying creature, you can choose not to roll your expertise die in order to also automatically treat deadly wounds on that creature if your Medicine check is successful. The DC for the check is based on the medical equipment used, using the DC for treat deadly wounds + 5. This does not count as the treat deadly wounds treatment for the purposes of how many times per day a creature can receive this treatment, though a creature can only benefit from battlefield medic once per day. If you also have the surgeon expertise talent, you can increase the DC of a battlefield medic-related Medicine check by a total of 10 to use battlefield medic to treat deadly wounds on a creature one additional time per day (which does not count as a use of the surgeon expertise talent).


## BORROWED GUISE (EX; DISGUISE)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_
While you are wearing or wielding one or more items with a combined bulk of 1 or more that you have taken from another creature, you can more readily assume a false identity, disguising yourself as a creature of the same race or organization. You don’t need a disguise kit to attempt a Disguise check to change your appearance when using this expertise talent, though using one grants you a +2 bonus to your check. If you forgo rolling your expertise die, changing your appearance takes only 1d3 minutes rather than 1d3 × 10 minutes.  
  
Alternatively, if you have the materials that qualify for you to use this expertise talent, you may forgo your expertise die to attempt to disguise yourself as that exact creature. Anyone who knows that creature well gains a +10 bonus to Perception checks to oppose your disguise.

##   CAUTIOUS EXPERTISE (EX; SEE BELOW)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_
Choose a skill you have selected with the skill expertise class feature. When you take 20 (see page 133) with this skill, you can roll your expertise die twice and take the better result.  
  
You can choose this talent up to three times, choosing a different skill selected with the skill expertise class feature each time.

##   COMPUTER WHIZ (EX; COMPUTERS)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_
When you attempt a Computers check, you can choose not to roll your expertise die until later. After you determine what the check’s result would be, you can choose to either roll your expertise die and add it to the total or forgo the expertise die and reroll the check. At 9th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to both reroll the check and add the result of your expertise die.

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_
As long as you have enough time, you can take 20 on Culture checks to recall knowledge, even if you don’t have access to a computer terminal or other means of research.

##   CUNNING DISGUISE (EX; DISGUISE)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 65_
When you attempt an initial Disguise check, you can forgo rolling your expertise die. Instead, the first time a creature would pierce your disguise with a Perception check, treat its result as if it had rolled a natural 1 on its Perception check. This benefit applies only once per disguise. At 9th level, this ability also applies against the second creature who pierces your disguise.

##   DEMOLITION EXPERT (EX; ENGINEERING)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 71_

##   EMPATHIC TRACKER (EX; SENSE MOTIVE)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 22_
Your ability to read emotions borders on the supernatural. As a full action, you can study a creature within 60 feet and attempt a Sense Motive check; you can choose not to roll your expertise die for this check. The DC of this check is equal to either 10 + the creature’s total Bluff skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the creature’s CR, whichever is greater. If you succeed, you can sense that creature as if you had blindsense (emotion) with a range of 30 feet (or a range of 60 feet if you chose to forego your expertise die) for 10 minutes. If you fail the check, you can’t try again for 10 minutes. You can only track one creature in this way at a time, plus an additional creature at 6th, 12th, and 18th levels. If you study another creature beyond this maximum, you cease detecting a creature of your choice with blindsense (emotion).

##   ENGINEERING ADEPT (EX; ENGINEERING)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 65_
When you attempt an Engineering check to disable or repair a device, you can forgo rolling your expertise die to instead halve the time it takes to make the attempt.

##   ENHANCE (EX; COMPUTERS)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 21_
You’ve mastered methods for improving the fidelity of digital images. When you use Perception or Sense Motive to examine a digital representation of a subject, such as one portrayed on a computer monitor, you can take 20 on your skill check in half the normal time (usually 1 minute), using your Computers skill in place of the applicable skill modifier. When using sensors to scan an enemy during starship combat, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to increase the sensors’ range increment by 5 hexes until the end of the round.

##   MIRACLE WORKER (EX; MEDICINE)

This increases to 3d8 at 4th level, 5d8 at 7th level, 12d8 at 10th level, 16d8 at 13th level, or 20d8 at 16th level.

##   ONE OF US (EX; CULTURE)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 23_
You use your knowledge of a culture to make others feel that you belong.

Whenever you attempt a Diplomacy check to change another’s attitude, a Disguise check to alter your appearance, or a Stealth check to hide by blending into a crowd, you can expend one of these bonus expertise dice to apply your expertise class feature to the check—though only if the check involves the place, society, or group about which you recalled knowledge.

When you rest for 8 hours to regain Resolve Points, any remaining bonus expertise dice are lost.  
You can use this expertise talent once per day without spending Resolve Points, and you must spend 1 Resolve Point each subsequent time you use the ability that day. If you use the expertise talent again, you lose any previously gained bonus expertise dice.

##   POWER USER (EX; COMPUTERS)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 21_

You’re a master at studying reactions in a conversation, sensing topics that might upset others and adjusting your own arguments on the fly. If you would fail a Bluff check to lie, a Diplomacy check to change attitude, or an Intimidate check to bully, you can roll your expertise die. If the sum of your skill check result plus the expertise die would have succeeded at the check, you realize you’re about to say something inopportune and can change the subject without causing suspicion; your check neither succeeds nor fails, allowing you to retry the action and skill check later by spending the necessary time again. Once you use this expertise talent, you can’t do so again for 1 hour or until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, whichever comes first.

##   REASONABLE EXCUSE (EX; BLUFF)

When caught in a compromising situation that clearly indicates your guilt or would initiate combat, you can attempt an immediate Bluff check before initiative is rolled to lie and absolve yourself, but you must forgo your expertise die on this check. A successful check will stop an outbreak of violence as long as you (and anyone with you) is cooperative with those you are lying to (for example, leaving a restricted area or handing over stolen property you happen to “find”). You cannot use this ability to escape consequences for violence and other overtly hostile actions.

## SAVING EXPERTISE (EX; SPECIAL)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 71_

##   SCENT OF DANGER (EX; SENSE MOTIVE)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 23_
You can smell when there’s trouble brewing. If you’re surprised in combat, you don’t have the flat-footed condition for being surprised against any combatants you can detect with blindsense (scent) or blindsight (scent). When you roll initiative and can detect at least one combatant with your blindsense (scent) or blindsight (scent), you can spend 1 Resolve Point to roll your expertise die and add its result as an insight bonus to your initiative check.  
You must have blindsense (scent) or blindsight (scent) to select this ability.

##   SECURITY AUDIT (EX; CULTURE)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 21_
You use your knowledge about the social or cultural tendencies of a computer’s owner to make educated guesses about likely passwords or other security practices. By testing possible passwords for 1 minute, you can attempt a Culture check (DC = the DC to hack the computer). If you succeed, you reduce the DC of Computers checks to hack the computer as though you had the proper password.

##   SKILLED LINGUIST (EX; CULTURE)

##   SLICK CUSTOMER (EX; DIPLOMACY)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 65_
When you attempt a Diplomacy check, you can choose not to roll your expertise die until later. After you determine what the check’s result would be, you can choose to either roll your expertise die and add it to the total or forgo the expertise die and reroll the check (see page 243). At 9th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to both reroll the check and add the result of your expertise die.

##   STEADY HANDS (EX; ENGINEERING)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 21_
You’re cool under pressure, and even your mistakes are less frequently catastrophic. Once per day, if you fail by 5 or more while using Engineering to arm an explosive or to disable a device, you can immediately reroll the check.

##   STONE-FACED LIAR (EX; BLUFF)

**Source** _Near Space pg. 128_  
You deliver lies in a monotone as naturally as any other routine communication. When you attempt a Bluff check to lie, you can forgo your expertise die to make the DC of your Bluff check equal to 10 + the target’s total Sense Motive bonus, even if the target is suspicious of you. At 9th level, you can instead spend 1 Resolve Point to use the above DC, add your expertise die instead of forgoing it, and ignore the modifier the DC would have if the target is unfriendly to you.  
Embri and non-embri characters can select these options if they have the fleshbound mask or masked emotions trait.

##   STUDENT OF TECHNOLOGY (EX; ENGINEERING)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 65_
As long as you have the time to do so, you can take 20 (see page 133) on Engineering checks to identify creatures and technology, even if you do not have access to a computer terminal or other means of research. If the creature or technology was created by a group or individual you are familiar with (normally including any major corporation or military), on a successful check you also identify what group created the object identified.

##   SURGEON (EX; MEDICINE)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 65_
You can use Medicine to treat deadly wounds on a patient once each day in addition to the normal allowances for the medical equipment you are using. Because performing this level of advanced medicine is difficult and time consuming, the DC for this additional treatment increases by 5 and the skill check takes 1 hour.

##   TECH FAMILIARITY (EX; CULTURE)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_
If you forgo rolling your expertise die on a Culture check, you can use Culture to identify hybrid, magic, and technological items as though you were using the Engineering or Mysticism skills.

##   UNIVERSAL DIPLOMAT (EX; DIPLOMACY)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 71_
Your Diplomacy checks to change a creature’s attitude are not language-dependent. This allows you to use Diplomacy to change the attitude of a creature with whom you do not share a common language, as well as a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 (creatures with no Intelligence score can’t have their attitudes improved using the Diplomacy skill unless the GM says otherwise).

##   WELL INFORMED (EX; DIPLOMACY)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 65_
You keep yourself as up to date as possible about the events and major figures of any region you are in. Once you have been in a settlement or region for at least 24 hours, when you attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information, you can forgo your expertise die to attempt the check as a swift action (rather than the normal 1d4 hours).

##   YOU DON’T SAY (EX; DIPLOMACY)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 23_
Your talent for careful listening often coaxes others into volunteering intriguing information. When you use Diplomacy to gather information, you can forego rolling your expertise die. If you do so and succeed at the check, you learn an additional piece of information about the chosen topic or individual. Using this ability requires at least 10 minutes of interaction, even if you have an ability that would allow you to gather information more quickly.
