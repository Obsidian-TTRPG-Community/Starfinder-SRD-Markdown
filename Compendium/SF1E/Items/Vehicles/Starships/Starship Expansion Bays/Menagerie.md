## Menagerie

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 28_  
**PCU**:: 1
**Cost (in BP)**:: 5  
Whether looking to transport and research zoological specimens or display living trophies, a menagerie provides a place to house, care for, and observe alien creatures in environmentally controlled cages. Four Medium creatures, two Large creatures, or one Huge creature can be maintained comfortably. These numbers can be doubled if the comfort of the captured aliens isnâ€™t a concern, though the risk of sickness and violence increases. Held creatures can be used for the research downtime activity (Character Operations Manual 155), and the facility can be used for the lounge downtime activity (Character Operations Manual 153).
