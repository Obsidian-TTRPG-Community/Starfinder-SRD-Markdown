SFS Legal Rancher (+1 Str)
Source Starfinder Enhanced pg. 16
In a galaxy filled with faster-than-light travel, virtual reality, and space stations housing millions, many people forget where their food comes from. Even those who exclusively dine on MREs and whatever comes out of their culinary synthesizers donâ€™t stop and consider the inspiration behind their food-like cuisine. Even for cultures who travel the stars, livestock are a critical part of the economy and remain a key component of many products. As a rancher, you have first-hand experience raising, protecting, and perhaps even rendering domestic animals. You are aware of the symbiotic nature of life throughout the universe and want to experience that sublime relationship for yourself, rather than waiting for the proverbial space cows to come home.
