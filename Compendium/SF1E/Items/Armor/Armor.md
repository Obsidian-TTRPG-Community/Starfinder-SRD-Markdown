# Armor

Armor is usually the easiest and most cost-effective way for creatures to protect themselves. Whether you are skimming through space aboard a mercenary vessel, attending a diplomatic meeting on a space station, or descending to a planet’s surface to explore, armor provides you with protection against attacks and hostile environments.  
  
Modern armor is made of many different substances, including carbon fiber, ceramic, fabric, metal, and polymers. Most are constructed from a combination of materials, and some even use archaic materials such as animal hide. Creatures wear armor to protect themselves, but also to express their personal style.  
  
Most suits of armor consist of a helmet, gloves, boots, and a bodysuit that offers head-to-toe protection. Unless otherwise specified, the boots include a functionality that can anchor your feet to a solid surface in a zero-gravity [[Environment, Atmospheres & Dangers]], allowing you to orient yourself or return to normal footing when needed (for more about moving in zero-g, see page 402).   

# Reading Armor Tables

Each entry on the armor tables starting on page 197 describes a single suit of armor, with the following statistics. 

-   **Level**: The armor’s item level (see page 167).
-   **Price**: This is the price in credits of the suit of armor.
-   **EAC Bonus**: This is the bonus your armor adds to your Energy Armor Class, which protects against attacks from laser [[Mech Weapons]], plasma cannons, and the like (see page 240).
-   **KAC Bonus**: This is the bonus your armor adds to your Kinetic Armor Class, which protects against projectiles, most melee weapons, and other solid objects (see page 240).
-   **Maximum Dex Bonus**: You normally add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class (for both EAC and KAC), but it’s limited by your armor. Your armor’s maximum Dexterity bonus indicates how much of your Dexterity modifier you can add to AC. Any excess Dexterity doesn’t raise your AC further and is simply ignored for this purpose.
-   **Armor Check Penalty**: You take a penalty to most Strengthand Dexterity-based [[Skill Checks]] equal to this number. See Chapter 5 for a more complete list of which [[Skills]] apply.
-   **Speed Adjustment**: While wearing the armor, your speed is adjusted by this number.
-   **Upgrade Slots**: You can improve your armor with magic and technological upgrades. This entry shows how many total upgrades your armor can accommodate. Some [[Armor Upgrades]] are larger or more complicated and take up multiple upgrade slots (see page 204.)
-   **Bulk**: This is the bulk of the item (see page 167).

# Wearing Armor

A character’s class and [[Feats|feats]] determine what kinds of armor they can wear. Further details about wearing armor are below.   

## Armor Proficiency

If you are wearing armor with which you are not proficient, you take a –4 penalty to both EAC and KAC (see page 240). A character who is proficient only with [[Light Armor]] can wear heavier armor effectively by selecting the [[Heavy Armor]] Proficiency feat.   

## Donning Armor

The time required to don or remove armor depends on its type. [[Light Armor]] requires 4 rounds to don or remove, while [[Heavy Armor]] requires 16 rounds to don or remove.  
  
Armor that is at least 8th level but less than 16th level takes half the normal time to don or remove. Armor of 16th level or higher takes one-quarter the normal time to don or remove, to a minimum of one full action.  
  
Modern suits of armor are designed so that you can don or remove armor without assistance.   

## Don Hastily

You can hastily don armor in half the normal time, to a minimum of one full action. The armor check penalty, maximum Dexterity bonus, and armor bonus for hastily donned armor are each 1 worse than normal.   

# Armor Size

Armor comes in different sizes for different creatures, and you might have to adjust a suit of armor to fit you if it wasn’t made for your race. A [[Ysoki]] can’t effectively wear armor made for a [[Human]], and a [[Kasatha]] needs to adjust armor that was made for a two-armed creature. If it’s in doubt whether a creature can fit the suit, the GM decides whether the armor needs to be adjusted. When you buy armor new, the purchase price includes any adjustments.   

# Adjusting Armor

If you get secondhand armor that wasn’t tailored for you, you can have it adjusted, which requires a successful Engineering check (DC = 10 + 2 × the armor’s level). Alternatively, you can spend 10% of the armor’s purchase price to have it adjusted by a professional—typically an armorsmith or anyone with multiple ranks in Engineering.   

# Environmental Protections

Space can be an inhospitable place, with countless dangerous worlds within it. Unless otherwise specified, all armors protect you from a range of [[Starship Combat Hazards]] to ensure that you can survive for at least a few days if you must make emergency repairs to the hull of a starship, explore an alien world, or endure exposure to an environmental breach in a space station. Some armors do this through an environmental field (a minor [[Force Field]] specially attuned to pressure and temperature that does not reduce [[Damage]] from attacks), while others can be closed with helmets and airtight seals. The most common environmental dangers are detailed in [[Environment, Atmospheres & Dangers]] beginning on page 394.   

## Activation and Duration

A suit of armor’s environmental protections last for a number of days equal to its item level. Activating or deactivating these environmental protections takes a standard action if you are wearing the suit (assuming the armor was properly donned). If you have access to a suit that is unattended or worn by a [[helpless]] creature, you can turn on its environmental protection as a full action, but turning it off requires a Computers check to hack the system, treating the suit as a computer with a tier equal to half the suit’s item level (the base DC to hack a computer is equal to 13 + 4 per tier).  
  
The duration of a suit’s environmental protections does not need to be expended all at once, but it must be expended in 1-hour increments. Recharging this duration requires access to a functioning starship or an [[Environment, Atmospheres & Dangers]] recharging station (publicly available in most technologically advanced or average settlements) and takes 1 minute per day recharged. Most of the recharging stations that replenish devices, such as batteries and power cells (see page 234), also [[Recharge]] armor’s environmental protections, and using them to [[Recharge]] suits is typically free of price. All other functions on a suit of armor with no duration remaining still work normally.   

## Breathing and Pressure

All armor can facilitate self-contained breathing, protecting you against vacuums, smoke, and thick, thin, and toxic atmospheres (including any airborne poison or disease). Self-contained breathing functions underwater and in similar liquid environments. This protection allows you to breathe in a [[Corrosive]] [[Starships in Atmosphere]] (see page 395) to prevent suffocation, but it isn’t strong enough to prevent a corrosive [[Starships in Atmosphere]] from dealing acid [[Damage]] to both you and your armor. A suit of armor with an upgrade that grants acid resistance reduces any acid [[Damage]] taken from a corrosive [[Starships in Atmosphere]] normally. Any vision impairment from the [[Environment, Atmospheres & Dangers]] (such as smoke or water) still applies.   

## Radiation

Armor protects you against low levels of radiation (see page 403) and grants a +4 circumstance bonus to [[Saving Throws]] against higher levels of radiation. Armor of 7th level and higher grants immunity to medium radiation levels and provides a +6 circumstance bonus to [[Saving Throws]] against higher levels of radiation. No armor’s bonuses apply to saves against radiation sickness, regardless of the level of radiation exposure that caused you to contract it.   

## Temperature

Armor’s environmental protections reasonably protect you against both cold (temperatures below –20° F) and heat (air temperatures over 140° F). This prevents you from having to attempt Fortitude [[Saving Throws]] to avoid [[Damage]] from the [[Environment, Atmospheres & Dangers]], and it prevents you from taking any [[Damage]] listed for breathing in the [[Environment, Atmospheres & Dangers]]. This does not protect against cold or fire [[Damage]] from other sources or against environments that deal [[Damage]] without allowing a Fortitude saving throw or breathing the [[Starships in Atmosphere]] (such as lava).)

# Armor Descriptions

The suits of armor listed in the tables are described below.

## Abadarcorp Travel Suit (GOLD, Platinum, SILVER)

AbadarCorp executives popularized these light armor business suits for boardrooms and diplomatic meetings. Contingent force fields and concealed rebreathers protect the wearer in hostile environmental conditions. Higher grades of travel suits offer more protection—along with a designer label.

## Aegis Series (ELITE, Specialist, SQUAD)

Aegis suits of heavy armor cover wearers entirely, leading to the suits’ nickname of “personal tanks.” Helmet visors are narrow or nonexistent, instead projecting video and audio feeds to the wearer. Power-assisted limbs allow the wearer to move intuitively with the suit on.

## Carbon Skin (DIAMOND, Graphite, Nanotube, White CARBON)

Though these suits of light armor appear to be made of stiff fabric, they are actually woven from carbon fibers. Higher-quality carbon skins are reinforced with carbon allotypes, such as white carbon or diamond, and the heightened sheen of the fabric hints at their expensive construction.

## Ceremonial Plate (COMMANDER, Officer, TROOP)

While this heavy armor of sculpted metal plates offers good protection to the wearer, its main purpose is to intimidate enemies. Often used for honor guards, military exercises, or parades, ceremonial plate is usually brightly colored or made of shining metal, with elaborate helmets.

## D-suit (I-VI)

Disembarkment suits, or d-suits, are designed for spacefarers who expect to leave their ship and visit a planet’s surface. Most d-suits are jumpsuits or flight suits worn under reinforced breeches, heavy boots, and a thick jacket. A helmet or rebreather and a utility belt with an attached holster complete the outfit.

## Defiance Series (ELITE, Specialist, SQUAD)

The defiance series of heavy armor is the workhorse of squad armor. A formed hard shell overlays a suit of para-aramids, creating a bulky and solid protective outfit. Defiance series helmets have wide, tinted visors to allow peripheral vision.

## Defrex Hide

Made from the hide of a ferocious mammal native to Vesk-2, this light armor is popular among vesk but less often worn by other races. Tanned stretches of the creature’s thick hide are stitched together with metal wires, and the suits are reinforced with metal studs or scales.

## Echelon Fashion (BESPOKE, Ready to WEAR)

Modeled after the universe’s most cutting-edge fashions, this lightly armored clothing is available in daring modern designs, using force fields and the highest-tech fibers to create any sort of outfit imaginable. Bespoke echelon fashions are often tailor- made for the orderer and meant to look unique. The ysoki popularized this seemingly lightweight but incredibly 

## Enginerunner

durable heavy armor. Small squares of dense metal lie between two layers of reinforced fiber weave, giving the appearance of a padded flight suit but offering considerably more protection.

## Estex Suit (I-IV)

Estex is a thick, durable fabric most often used to make flight suits and environmental suits. Estex suits cover the wearer from the neck down and can be modified with armor upgrades SKILLS as needed. Higher-quality estex suits grant a better level of protection and allow for more upgrades, though they are often  
bulkier than comparable suits of light armor.

## Freebooter Armor (I-V)

Popularized by the Free Captains of the Diaspora, freebooter armor features an armored jacket or breastplate, heavy boots and gloves, numerous straps and hidden weapons, and a helmet. Novice explorers and mercenaries beginning their career sometimes choose freebooter armor for the air of rakish experience this light armor lends its wearer.

## Golemforged Plating (I-V)

An economical choice for many mercenaries, golemforged plating is one of the universe’s most popular heavy armors. Golemforged plating consists of a close-fitting polycarbonate suit fitted with ports and sockets to fit most armor customization options. Suits of golemforged plating include flexible boots and gloves as well as a standard helmet with a clear visor.

## Hardlight Series (ELITE, Specialist, SQUAD)

The last word in light infantry armor, hardlight series armor features an inflexible, lightweight breastplate, limb guards, and a helmet over a smooth and formfitting jumpsuit. Manufacturers often make custom armor for military organizations, but off-the- rack armor of differing qualities is also available to mercenaries and explorers.

## Hidden Soldier Armor

Made by the kasatha, these suits of heavy armor are so named for their slitted helmets, which reveal only the eyes. A rebreather lets the wearer keep their faces completely covered. A ceramic breastplate, shoulder guards, bracers, and greaves protect the wearer while facilitating the graceful kasathan close-combat style.

## Iridishell (ADVANCED, Basic, SUPERIOR)

These gleaming metal plates lock together to form a suit of heavy armor reminiscent of an insect’s shell. Although the iridishell was initially designed for shirrens, its beauty combined and functionality makes it a popular choice for many. More expensive suits of iridishell not only offer more protection
