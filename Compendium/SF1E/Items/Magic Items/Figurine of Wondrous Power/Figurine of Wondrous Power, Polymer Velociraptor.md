### Description

This plastic miniature, though expertly painted and shaded with acrylics to look like a primeval creature, could easily be mistaken as some game piece for a strategy game. You can transform it into a dromaeosaurid (Alien Archive 2 38). It behaves toward you much like a family pet, defending you fiercely.
