Benefit: When you cast polymorph on yourself and choose to transform into a predetermined polymorph form from a lower-level list of forms you know, you increase the spell’s duration. If you transform into a form that’s from a list one level lower, the duration increases to 5 minutes/level (D). If you transform into a form that’s from a list two levels lower, the duration increases to 1 hour/level (D). If you transform into a form that’s from a list three levels lower, the spell’s duration lasts until the next time you regain spell slots.
Prerequisites: You know the polymorph spell as a 2nd-level spell or higher.
