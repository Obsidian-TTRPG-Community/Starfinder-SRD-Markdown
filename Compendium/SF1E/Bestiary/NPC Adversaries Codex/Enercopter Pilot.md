# ENERCOPTER PILOT
Emergency workers administer medical care, handle hazardous materials, evacuate disaster victims, and provide myriad other services in the wake of tragedy. They can be selfless idealists, exhausted municipal workers, or mercenaries who don’t lift a finger unless they’re under contract. Whatever their motivations, emergency workers are capable, resourceful, and tough, able to work long hours under difficult conditions.

## DESCRIPTION

When disaster strikes beyond reach of intact infrastructure, aerial support is crucial to delivering supplies, surveying damage, and extracting survivors. Enercopter pilots are airborne daredevils who brave narrow landing zones, hazardous weather, and live fire to save lives. Although the stat block below doesn’t include a vehicle, these pilots are typically encountered with a recon enercopter (Armory 138).
