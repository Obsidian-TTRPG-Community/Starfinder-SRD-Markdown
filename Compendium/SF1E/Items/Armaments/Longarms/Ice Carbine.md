# Ice Carbine

Rather than relying on coolant to produce supercooled gas, an ice carbine pumps heat out of large vents integrated in the weapon’s stock and uses the temperature change to produce brittle, razor-sharp shards of ice in the chamber. This design allows it to either fire a short, targeted shot or spray a hailstorm of piercing needles at a group of foes. The heat-exchange technology used in these weapons is common on Verces, where it’s used for many purposes, making it relatively easy to find them in the Pact Worlds, from the subzero models (often built in illicit basement labs) to absolute-zero ice carbines, which are the best in the Pact Worlds. Gelid and ultracold ice carbines improve on the subzero version’s technology and overall power.

## Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
