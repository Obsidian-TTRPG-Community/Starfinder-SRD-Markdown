# NULL-SPACE CHAMBER
A _null-space chamber_ is a circular device often designed to be strapped to an arm or backpack. When you press a button on the side, the device creates a circular extradimensional rift to a pocket space, the size of which is determined by the null-space chamber’s model. You can close it by pressing the button again, causing the entrance to the space to disappear. Anything stored within the space remains, however, traveling with the item. The _null-space chamber_ can be opened and closed only from the outside.  
  
The only air within the pocket space is that which enters when you open the entrance. The device does not accumulate bulk even as its pocket space is filled. Each _null-space chamber_ is associated with its own particular extradimensional space. Each _null-space chamber_ can carry a set amount of bulk, after which it can no longer be closed (even if it has room left for more material). Spells and items that contain or create extradimensional spaces, such as other _null-space chambers_, do not function within a _null-space chamber’s_ pocket dimension.  
  
A readout on a _null-space chamber_ automatically catalogs all items within it, and if the chamber is open, you can call up any such item and have it placed in your hand as a full action.
