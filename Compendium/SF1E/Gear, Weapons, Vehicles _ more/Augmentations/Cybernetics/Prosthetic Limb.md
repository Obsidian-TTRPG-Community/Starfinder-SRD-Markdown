# PROSTHETIC LIMB
This prosthesis replaces a missing limb. It restores functionality, but it is no more durable than and doesn’t otherwise function differently than a normal limb for your species. A prosthetic limb can replace one you’ve lost, or you can have a limb removed in order to replace it with a prosthetic.  
  
A storage prosthetic limb has a built-in concealed storage compartment, which functions as a hideaway limb (see above).
