# Countermeasure - Shock Grid

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 215_  
**Price** Varies; **Type** Countermeasure  
The computer and its surrounding environment are protected by a grid of conductive material that transmits a shock to anyone who fails to access the system. This has two settings: one meant to stun and one meant to kill. Normally, the stun setting happens first, with a warning about lethal force should the intruder make another attempt. The stun setting forces all creatures within 10 feet of the terminal to succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be stunned for 1 round. The lethal setting affects nearby creatures like the stun setting but also deals electricity damage to all creatures within 10 feet of the computer, allowing a Reflex save for half damage. The save DC, damage dealt, and price all depend upon the rank of the shock grid, as indicated on the below table. Each rank added counts as one countermeasure when determining the total number of countermeasures a system can have. Only computers fixed permanently to a floor or similar surface can have shock grids.

| Rank | DC | Damage | Price  |
|------|----|--------|--------|
| 1    | 20 | 8d6    | 500    |
| 2    | 22 | 10d6   | 2,000  |
| 3    | 24 | 12d6   | 5,000  |
| 4    | 27 | 14d6   | 20,000 |
| 5    | 30 | 16d6   | 50,000 |
