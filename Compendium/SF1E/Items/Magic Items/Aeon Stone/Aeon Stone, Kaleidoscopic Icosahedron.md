## Aeon Stone, Kaleidoscopic Icosahedron

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 110_
**Level**:: 12
**Price**::  35000
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

The _kaleidoscopic icosahedron_ originated within the Azlanti Star Empire as an award given to high-ranking members of the Aeon Guard. While the stone orbits you, if you roll a d20 and you dislike the result, as a reaction you can reroll the d20 and use the better result. Alternatively, as a reaction when you are the target of an attack, you can force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the worse result. Once you have used the stone to cause a reroll, you can’t do so again for 24 hours, and you can benefit from no other _kaleidoscopic icosahedron_ during this time.
