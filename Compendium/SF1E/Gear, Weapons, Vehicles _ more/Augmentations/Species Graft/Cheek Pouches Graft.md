# CHEEK POUCHES GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 143_  
**Item Level** 6; **Price** 3,900; **System** Throat  
Ysoki’s cheeks are remarkably stretchy, and they use this to their advantage. Durable skin implanted in your own cheeks affords you the same benefit. You can store up to 1 cubic foot of items weighing up to 1 bulk in total in your new cheek pouches, and you can transfer a single object between hand and cheek as a swift action. You can disgorge the entire contents of your pouches onto the ground in your square as a move action that doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity.
