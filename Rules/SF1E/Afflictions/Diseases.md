# Diseases

Diseases are typically inhaled contagions (though these are usually filtered out by a standard space suit or suit of [[Armor]]) or injury contagions. Page 417 explains the details of each method of contagion. If a disease lacks a Cure entry, its progression may be irreversible without powerful magic or technology, but a successful casting of _[[Remove Affliction]]_ usually prevents further deterioration. Physical and mental diseases have separate tracks.

# Addiction

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 418_  
**Type** disease (drug use); **Save** see specific drug  
**Track** physical, mental, or both (see specific drug); **Frequency** 1/day when not using the drug  
**Effect** If a creature takes a drug while it has progressed beyond healthy on the drug’s progression track, the DC of the saving throw against addiction increases by 2. A creature can attempt a save against an addiction only on a day when it hasn’t taken the drug. Each day spent without using the drug decreases the addiction’s DC by 2, to a minimum of the starting DC, but using the drug again, even once, returns the DC to its highest value. Each drug addiction is a separate disease.
