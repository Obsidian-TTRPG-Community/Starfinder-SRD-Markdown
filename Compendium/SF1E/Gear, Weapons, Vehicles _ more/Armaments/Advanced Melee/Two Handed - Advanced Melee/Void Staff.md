Quite common on Eox, void staves are designed using extensive necromancy-derived technologies, resulting in nonreflective black coloration and a range of morbid effects. A target struck by a void staff suffers effects similar to frostbite, as the weapon drains the life energy out of the target on a cellular level and, in some cases, causes complications with breathing and other essential functions. Grave-class, crypt-class, tomb-class, and ossuary-class void staves are relatively common throughout the Pact Worlds, while barrow-class void staves are almost never seen anywhere except Eox.

# CRYO WEAPONS

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
