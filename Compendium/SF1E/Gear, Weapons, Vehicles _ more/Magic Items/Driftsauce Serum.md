### DESCRIPTION

Distilled and condensed from Drift gases before being enchanted, this tasteless serum resembles pink-hued quicksilver. Drinking the serum allows you to perceive and predict the Drift’s fluctuating space and faint currents, granting you a +5 insight bonus to Piloting checks to navigate the Drift for any journey you begin within the next hour. When calculating your travel time for the journey, you can reroll any one die whose result is 6 and use the second result.
