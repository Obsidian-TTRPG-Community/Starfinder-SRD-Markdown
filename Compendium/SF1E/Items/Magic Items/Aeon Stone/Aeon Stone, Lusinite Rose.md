### Description

Renowned for its iridescence, the gemstone lusinite has a dazzling quality that often sees the mineral hoarded by birds and other animals as treasures. As an aeon stone, it captivate creatures in three ways. As part of the action used to cast a spell with the charm descriptor, you can activate this aeon stone to negate any bonus to the saving throw one target might receive for being threatened or attacked by you or your allies. Second, you can activate the aeon stone as a reaction when you attempt a Charisma check to convince a charmed creature to follow your suggestions. Third, you can activate the aeon stone as a reaction when a threatening behavior by you or your allies would end the effects of your spell with the charm descriptor. The charmed creature attempts a Will save against the spell with a +5 enhancement bonus if it succeeds, it ends the spell as normal, but if it fails, that threatening action does not break the spell (though subsequent actions might do so).

You can activate the lusinite rose twice per day, using any combination of these three effects. A creature is immune to the aeon stone’s effects if it cannot see the item.
