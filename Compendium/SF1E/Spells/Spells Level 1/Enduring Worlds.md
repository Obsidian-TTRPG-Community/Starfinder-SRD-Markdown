## Description

You cast this spell during the duration of an ongoing environmental effect youâ€™ve created using your infinite worlds class feature, refining your grasp on the overlapping realities around you. When you do so, this spell extends those effects for its duration. If you have used infinite worlds to create multiple effects, you can use this spell to extend any number of them.
