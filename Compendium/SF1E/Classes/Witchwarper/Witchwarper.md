# WITCHWARPER
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 60_  
Most people believe that reality is limited to their physical surroundings. You know the truth: that everything around you is merely a thin veil draped across the infinite tapestry of existence. Your reality is a palimpsest, with all possible worlds and all alternate existences at your disposal. Through your magic and force of personality, you can peer into these time lines and pull from them as you see fit, using their dimensional echoes to twist and reshape your own world.

**Hit Points**: 5  
**Stamina Points**: 5

## KEY ABILITY SCORE - CHA

Your Charisma score determines your spellcasting ability, the saving throw DCs of your spells, and the number of bonus spells you can cast per day, so Charisma is your key ability score. A high Dexterity score can help you fire weapons more accurately and dodge incoming attacks.

## CLASS SKILLS

The Witchwarper's class skills are Acrobatics (Dex), Bluff (Cha), Culture (Int), Diplomacy (Cha), Intimidate (Cha), Mysticism (Wis), Physical Science (Int), Profession (Cha, Int, or Wis).

**Skill Points at each Level**: 4 + Int modifier.

## PROFICIENCIES

### ARMOR

Light armor

### WEAPONS

Basic melee weapons, small arms, and grenades

You cast spells drawn from the witchwarper spell list. To learn or cast a spell, you must have a Charisma score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against your spell is 10 + the spell’s level + your Charisma modifier.

You can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Your number of spells per day is given on Table 2–3: Witchwarper. In addition, you receive bonus spells per day if you have a Charisma modifier of +1 or higher, as shown on Table 2–4: Witchwarper Bonus Spells—note that you receive these bonus spells only once you can cast spells of that level normally. You can also cast 0-level spells—these spells are cast like any other spell, but there is no limit to how many 0-level spells you can cast each day.

Your selection of spells is limited. You begin play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of your choice. At each new witchwarper level, you learn one or more new spells, as indicated on Table 2–5: Witchwarper Spells Known. Unlike your spells per day, the number of spells you know isn’t affected by your Charisma modifier.

Every time you gain a new level, you can swap out one spell you already know and learn a single new spell of the same level in its place. In effect, you lose the old spell in exchange for the new one. You must choose whether or not to swap a spell at the same time you gain new spells known for the level.

You can cast any witchwarper spell you know at any time, assuming you have not yet used up your allotment of spells per day for the spell’s level. You can also cast a spell using a higherlevel spell slot. For instance, if you want to cast a 1st-level spell but have used up all your 1st-level spells for the day, you can use a 2nd-level spell slot instead, if you have one.

You can also decipher magical inscriptions that would otherwise be unintelligible or, as a full action, identify any spells encoded in a spell gem. This does not normally invoke the magic contained within, although it may do so in the case of a cursed or trapped spell gem.

## INFINITE WORLDS (SU) - 1ST LEVEL

As a standard action, you can create a bubble of altered reality, projecting elements of parallel existences into your current universe. You expend a witchwarper spell slot of 1st level or higher to create an environmental effect, such as summoning fog or thick vines from other realities, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your class level unless specified otherwise. Alternatively, you can create an instantaneous effect, such a flash of fire from an explosion that occurred in a parallel universe. The particular effects depend on the level of the spell slot expended.

All effects created by infinite worlds use the following rules unless they say otherwise. They have a range of 100 feet + 10 feet per witchwarper level and affect a 10-foot-radius spread. If you create multiple effects with one use of infinite worlds, they all originate at the same point. If an effect calls for a saving throw, the DC is equal to 10 + the spell level expended to create the effect + your Charisma modifier. You can define the cause and appearance of infinite worlds however you wish (subject to GM approval), but the effects themselves are only quasi-real and have no effects beyond the game mechanics listed as options for this ability.

You can instead create multiple, milder effects in place of a single, more powerful effect. When you do this, you select two effects available to any version of this ability created by expending a lower-level spell slot than that you actually expend. For calculations based on spell level, use the level of the spell slot you expend.

For example, a 10th-level witchwarper could expend a 3rd‑level spell slot and select either a 3rd-level effect or any two abilities normally created by expending 1st- or 2nd-level spells.

The environmental and instantaneous effects you can create by sacrificing a witchwarper spell slot of a given level are as follows:

-   **1st (Environmental):** You cause the affected area to become difficult terrain. This might mean that metal flooring becomes rickety and bowed, a waterway is choked by roots and seaweed, or the air is flooded with floating strands of web-like filaments. You can affect a single movement type (land speed, burrow speed, climb speed, fly speed, or swim speed) or any combination of those movement types. When you create difficult terrain in this way, it is considered magically altered terrain for the purposes of other effects.
-   **1st (Instantaneous):** You cause a bright flash of light to fill the area. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Fortitude saves or be dazzled for 1 round per witchwarper level. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw (meaning the d20 shows a “1”), it is also blinded for 1 round.
-   **1st (Environmental):** You cause difficult terrain in the affected area to become normal terrain. When you eliminate non-magical difficult terrain in this way, you create magically altered terrain.
-   **2nd (Environmental):** You cause a hazard that deals damage each round equal to the level of the spell slot expended, with a successful Fortitude save reducing the damage by half. A creature attempts this save when it first takes damage from this effect, and its result applies for the duration of the effect. You select the damage type each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic).
-   **2nd (Instantaneous):** You cause a destabilizing event, such as a brief earthquake, a split-second reversal of gravity, or a blast of icy wind. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also moved 5 feet per level of the spell slot expended in a direction of your choice.
-   **2nd (Environmental):** You stabilize the affected area, steadying unsteady terrain, preventing collapse, and filling gaps. Reduce the DCs to avoid falling, maintain footing, and balance in the area by 5. The area can collapse only due to circumstances that change after you create this effect or if the GM rules stability is impossible. For example, you can hold a collapsing cave in place for the duration but not a platform lacking any other support. Any round during which you use a standard action to maintain this effect doesn’t count against its duration, but the effect can last for a maximum of 1 minute per witchwarper level you have.
-   **3rd (Environmental):** You cause the area to grant concealment against one sense—vision, emotion, life, scent, sound, thought, or vibration.
-   **3rd (Instantaneous):** You cause a disorienting event, such as bursts of flashing colors and loud sounds, or rain falling upward in spirals. Each creature within the area must succeed at a Will save or be knocked off-target for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell expended. If a creature rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw, it is also staggered for 1 round.
-   **3rd (Environmental):** You create a translucent sphere of protection centered on you that moves with you. This barrier and bubble of altered reality might be a thin, semisolid fog, a field of wind, or a bubble inside a film of ectoplasm. This sphere’s boundary provides soft cover and concealment. Atmosphere, gravity, and temperature are tolerable for any creature inside the sphere. Any round during which you use a standard action to maintain this effect doesn’t count against its duration, but the effect can last for a maximum of 1 minute per witchwarper level you have.
-   **4th (Environmental):** You create a barrier, the entirety of which must be within the range and area of infinite worlds’ environmental effects. The barrier is a number of 5-foot cubes no greater than double the level of the spell slot expended. The cubes must each connect along one side with at least one other cube, have hardness equal to double the level of the spell expended, and each have HP equal to 5 × the level of spell expended. Barriers you could summon might include old rusting barricades, slabs of ice, and so forth.
-   **4th (Instantaneous):** You create a burst of damage affecting everything in the area. You select the type of damage each time you use this ability (acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic), and it deals 2d6 damage per level of the spell expended (Reflex half).
-   **4th (Environmental):** You create open space in the affected area, provided any structural material and big masses, such as rubble or liquids, in the area have a hardness of 15 or lower. The effect makes it easy to temporarily excavate an area, removing all inanimate objects, but it’s harder to use to replace artificial structures, such as a standing stone building or vault, or to join strongly disparate environments, such as a starship interior and hard vacuum. The GM can increase a structure’s effective hardness by 10 if it meets these criteria. Creating this effect in an area with any structural material harder than hardness 15 requires you to succeed at a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level) against a DC equal to the hardness of the hardest structural material in the area. If this check fails, the alternate reality fails to manifest, and the spell slot used for this ability is expended with no effect.  
    This open space doesn’t damage surrounding structures or cause them to collapse, and it temporarily holds out moving materials, such as flowing water or unstable debris. If you open this space in an area that contains creatures, they remain and act appropriately according to other environmental factors that don’t change, such as atmosphere and gravity.  
    Any round during which you use a standard action to maintain this effect doesn’t count against its duration, but the effect can last for a maximum of 1 minute per witchwarper level you have. When the effect ends, creatures and objects that weren’t inside the open area before it appeared are safely shunted to the nearest open space outside the effect. Creatures and objects that were inside the area before it appeared and remained inside are safely shunted back to their original locations. You could, for instance, use this effect to rescue a creature buried in rubble, but removing the creature from the affected area before the superimposed space disappears is crucial.
-   **5th (Environmental):** You make the air thicker or thinner, or fill it with toxic vapors. Each creature breathing the air must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened as long as it remains in the area. A creature attempts a single save when it is first exposed to the infinite worlds, which determines for the duration of the ability whether breathing within the area sickens that creature.
-   **5th (Instantaneous):** You attempt to entangle all targets within the area. You might fill the area with chains, viscous glue, or quick-hardening cement. Each target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled and anchored in place for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Creatures that enter the area after you use this ability are not entangled.
-   **5th (Environmental):** Creatures in the area move and act normally despite being encumbered, entangled, exhausted, fatigued, off kilter, paralyzed, staggered, or hindered by another effect that reduces activity or speed, such as the slow spell. Within the area, creatures can’t be grappled or otherwise bound, and they automatically succeed at escaping from being grappled, pinned, or bound. Also, creatures ignore effects from the environment, such as from being underwater or in zero gravity, when moving and attacking. If a creature ignores an ongoing effect due to being in the area, the ongoing effect’s duration continues to elapse, and the effect resumes normally if the creature leaves the area or this effect ends.
-   **6th (Environmental):** You reduce the hardness of objects within the area by 50% (Fortitude negates), or increase their hardness by 10 (to a maximum of double their normal hardness).

## PARADIGM SHIFT - 2ND LEVEL

Paradigm shifts represent your ability to briefly install pieces of alternate realities into your own, subtly or radically changing your surroundings for a time. You learn your first paradigm shift at 2nd level, and an additional paradigm shift every 3 levels thereafter. Unless otherwise stated, the effects of a paradigm shift last for a number of rounds equal to your witchwarper level. If a paradigm shift allows a saving throw to resist its effects, the DC is equal to 10 + half your witchwarper level + your Charisma modifier.

Starting at 4th level, your ability to shuffle these realities improves. Upon gaining a witchwarper level (including at 4th level), you can swap out one paradigm shift you know for a different paradigm shift of the same level. You can instead select a paradigm shift of a lower level, but note the level of the original paradigm shift so that when you later swap out the same paradigm shift at later levels, you can select any paradigm shift of the original level or lower.)

The list of paradigm shifts appears following the class features.

## COMPOUND SIGHT (SU) - 3RD LEVEL

You can sift through many realities, gaining understanding of a task by seeing it attempted dozens of different ways. Choose a skill. You gain a +1 insight bonus to checks using that skill. This bonus increases by +1 at 6th level and every 3 levels thereafter. You can change your chosen skill every time you gain a witchwarper level. At 9th level, you become more adept with your compound sight and can choose two skills to apply it to.

## WEAPON SPECIALIZATION (EX) - 3RD LEVEL

You gain the Weapon Specialization feat as a bonus feat for each weapon type this class grants you proficiency with.

## ALTERNATE OUTCOME (SU) - 6TH LEVEL

You can use your grasp of other realities to swap an outcome in your current existence with that of a more favorable reality. As a reaction once per day, you can reroll one attack roll, saving throw, ability check, or skill check that you attempt. Alternatively, you can expend a use of this ability as a reaction to cause a critical hit against you or an ally within 100 feet to instead be a normal hit.

You gain one additional daily use of this ability at 12th level and again at 18th level.

## UNFOLD EXISTENCES (SU) - 19TH LEVEL

You have nearly unlimited insight into all possible worlds and can pluck power from them as you deem necessary. Select five paradigms shifts you don’t know but whose prerequisites you meet. These paradigm shifts must not require your level to be higher than 8th. You can use the selected paradigm shifts a total number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.

## REALITY STUTTER (SU) - 20TH LEVEL

Your force of will can infuse reality itself, changing key aspects of existence around you. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use any paradigm shift you know. This doesn’t take an action, but you must use this ability on your turn unless the paradigm shift can be used as a reaction. If the paradigm shift requires a reaction, you still can’t use it unless the stated trigger has occurred, but using it does not expend your reaction for the round. If the paradigm shift requires you to spend Resolve Points to use it, you must still spend those Resolve Points in addition to that spent to use this ability. You can use reality stutter only once per turn. You can use the unfold existences ability in conjunction with reality stutter; doing so expends a daily use of unfold existences as normal.

Furthermore, once per week, you can cast warp reality as a spell-like ability.
