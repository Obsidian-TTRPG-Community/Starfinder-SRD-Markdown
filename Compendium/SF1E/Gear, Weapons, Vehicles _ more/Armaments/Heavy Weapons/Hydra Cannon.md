# HYDRA CANNON
Rather than firing a single burst of plasma, a hydra cannon generates countless discrete plasma filaments that spread outward in a pattern reminiscent of crawling serpents. The spread of these filaments can be somewhat controlled, allowing a proficient user to avoid hitting a limited number of creatures within the weapon’s area of effect. Python-series hydra cannons offer the least control, while viper-series, asp-series, and cobraseries hydra cannons offer increasingly fine-tuned control over their target areas.

### PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
