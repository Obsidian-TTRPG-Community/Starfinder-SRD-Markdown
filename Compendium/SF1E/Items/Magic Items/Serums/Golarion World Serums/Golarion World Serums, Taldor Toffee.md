## Description

Adorning this light brown beverage’s label is a cartoon noble astride a horse and whose lance spears into a golden-furred lion above a slogan reading, “Classic flavor.” The sweet serum grants you a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of magical beasts.
