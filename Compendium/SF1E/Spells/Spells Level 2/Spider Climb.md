## Description

The target can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. An affected creature with four limbs must have three limbs free (not holding equipment or being used to perform skills and so on) to climb in this manner. A creature with six limbs needs only four available. In general, other creatures must have 75% of their limbs available to benefit from this spell. The target gains a climb speed of 20 feet (and the +8 racial bonus to Athletics checks to climb granted by that climb speed); furthermore, it doesn’t need to attempt Athletics checks to climb to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). An affected creature climbing in this way is not flat-footed while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. The creature, however, can’t use the run action while climbing.
