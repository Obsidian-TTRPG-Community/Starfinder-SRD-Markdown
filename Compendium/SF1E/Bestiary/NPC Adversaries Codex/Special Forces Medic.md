# Special Forces Medic

In many societies, practicing medicine requires extensive (and often formal) education and even certification. Yet the galaxy is a big, dangerous place, and some of the best healers are self-taught, work outside of official networks, or both. Altruism, prestige, or profit motivate most medics to provide life-saving care. However, medics can be villains, with criminals, charlatans, and unethical innovators willing to provide risky surgeries, experimental drugs, or cure-all placebos for the right price.

### Special Abilities

**Rapid Treatment (Ex)** A special forces medic can spend 1 Resolve Point to use Medicine to treat deadly wounds as a standard action rather than requiring 1 minute of treatment. If the Medicine check is successful, the target receives twice as many Hit Points as normal.  
**Shield the Fallen (Ex)** When the medic uses Medicine to provide first aid, treat deadly wounds, treat disease, or treat drugs or poison, they gain Bodyguard and In Harmâ€™s Way as bonus feats for 1 minute, but they can only use these feats to protect the target of their Medicine check.

## Description

For elite combat medics, doing their job often means exposing themselves to the same fangs and gunfire that wounded their comrades a moment earlier. These doctors are typically part of a military unit and receive training in combat and infiltration.
