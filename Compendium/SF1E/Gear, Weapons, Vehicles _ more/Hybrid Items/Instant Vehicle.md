# INSTANT VEHICLE
An instant vehicle is a miniature silver statuette of a vehicle with a small switch set into its base. You can flip the switch as a standard action, causing the statuette to transform into a fully operational version of the depicted vehicle at the beginning of your next turn. The vehicle appears either in your space (in which case you can board the vehicle without taking an action) or adjacent to you in a space that can support it; you can’t, for example, activate a land vehicle mid-air to create a falling hazard. You can deactivate the vehicle as a standard action, causing it to shrink into a statuette at the beginning of your next turn, harmlessly expelling its occupants into the nearest available spaces in the process.  
An instant vehicle can function as a vehicle for up to 24 hours, after which it permanently reverts to its statuette form and becomes nonmagical. This duration need not be continuous, but is measured in 1-hour increments. The vehicle regains 1 Hit Point every hour it remains in statuette form.
