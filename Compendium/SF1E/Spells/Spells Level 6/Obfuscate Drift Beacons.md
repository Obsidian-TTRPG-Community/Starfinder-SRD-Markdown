# Obfuscate Drift Beacons

**Classes**:: Mystic 6, Precog 6, Technomancer 6, Witchwarper 6

**Casting-Time**:: 1 hour  
**Range**:: system-wide  
**Duration**:: 1 day/level  
**Saving-Throw**:: None
**Spell Resistance**:: No

## Description

You obscure the Drift beacons in your current star system, making it more difficult to travel to that system. For the duration of the spell, the system takes 2d6 additional days to reach for the purposes of Drift travel to that system. This addition is factored in before dividing the result by a Drift engine’s rating, and a system can be affected by only one casting of this spell at a time.  
This spell has no effect if cast while not in a star system or while within the Drift, and it doesn’t increase the time it takes to travel to Absalom Station.
