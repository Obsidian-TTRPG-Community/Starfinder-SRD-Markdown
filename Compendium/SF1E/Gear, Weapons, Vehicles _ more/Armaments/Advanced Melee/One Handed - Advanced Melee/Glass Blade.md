This combat knife is made almost entirely from potassium-treated aluminosilicate glass, a strong, transparent material that retains the insulating properties of glass. A single exposed wire along the leading edge carries a deadly electric charge; the glass of the blade insulates the wearer against electrocution, and a rubberized grip makes it easy to hold. Live glass blades carry a continuous current, while the jolt, impulse, and surge models discharge upon impact.

# SHOCK WEAPONS

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
