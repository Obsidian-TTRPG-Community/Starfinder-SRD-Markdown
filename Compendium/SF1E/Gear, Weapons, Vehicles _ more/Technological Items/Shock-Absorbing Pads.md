### DESCRIPTION
Like a shock-absorbing helmet, these advanced technological knee and arm safety pads are generally sold to extreme athletes. When you fall while wearing shock-absorbing pads, you can convert the first 1d6 bludgeoning damage to nonlethal bludgeoning damage; this conversion is cumulative with damage reduced through deliberate jumps, successful Acrobatics checks, and other means (see shock-absorbing helmet, above). This requires no charges. In addition, as a reaction when you’re struck by a wound critical hit effect that targets your arm or leg, you can activate the high-tech shock-absorbing cushioning within the pads, consuming 1 charge and granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to the Fortitude saving throw.|
