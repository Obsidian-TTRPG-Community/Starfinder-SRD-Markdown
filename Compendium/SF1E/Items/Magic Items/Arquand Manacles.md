### Description

Interwoven hide from numerous Arquand gazelles lines _Arquand manacles_. Law officers and bounty hunters use these manacles on prisoners who might become aggressive. The interwoven strips help ensure the bound creature never becomes immune to the effect. While wearing _Arquand manacles_, you must succeed at a DC 13 Will save to attack, cast a spell, or attempt to disable, escape, or harm the cuffs. Arquand gazelles are immune to these manacles. Their magic is a mind-affecting, emotion effect.
