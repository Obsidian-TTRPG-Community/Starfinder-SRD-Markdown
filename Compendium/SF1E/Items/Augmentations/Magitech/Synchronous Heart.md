# Synchronous Heart

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 93_  
**Level**:: 7
**Price**::  6300 
**System**:: Heart  
Your heart is fitted with occult fixtures that connect its rhythm to the energy of nearby living creatures. You have blindsight (life) with a range of 30 feet, but only for dying and stable living creatures. As a reaction, you can allow an ally within 30 feet to spend your Resolve Points to stabilize or stay in the fight.
