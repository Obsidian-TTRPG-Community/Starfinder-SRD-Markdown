Silicanids have surged in popularity as pets, especially on worlds outside of the Weydana system. Although they can adapt to most environments, they don't reproduce in captivity, greatly increasing their value. Small breeding populations have been released into the wild on a handful of worlds in Near Space. Silicanids can be found on the black market, where they demand an emperorâ€™s ransom. Starfarers have happened upon silicanids on their adventures, adopting the creatures as companions.
