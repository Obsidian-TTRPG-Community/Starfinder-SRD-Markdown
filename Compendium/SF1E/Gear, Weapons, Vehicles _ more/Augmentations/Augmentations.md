# AUGMENTATIONS

## SYSTEM

All augmentations have a system entry indicating the part of the body into which it must be installed. You can’t have more than one augmentation on the same part of your body.  
  
In some cases, such as with augmentations installed in limbs, you can install an augmentation into a single general type of body part, such as any single one of your feet or hands. In these cases, the augmentation lists the acceptable body parts into which the augmentation can be installed. You can install a single augmentation on each limb of which you have multiples. For example, if you’re a [[Kasatha]], you could install a separate augmentation on each of your four hands, as long as each of those augmentations requires only a single hand.  
  
If an augmentation requires multiple limbs for installation— such as [[Climbing]] suckers, which require all feet, or a speed suspension, which requires all legs—the augmentation’s systems entry indicates that requirement. The augmentation’s description will also indicate whether a limb-based upgrade requires the replacement of a limb or the augmentation of an existing limb. In the case of augmentations that specifically replace a lost limb, such as a [[Polyhand]] or a [[Prosthetic Limb]], you cannot attach such an augmentation to an existing limb, due to the way these upgrades are manufactured.  
  
**Common Systems**: Although exceptions do exist, most augmentations require installation into one of the following body systems: arm (or all arms), brain, ears, eyes, foot (or all feet), hand (or all hands), heart, leg (or all legs), lungs, spinal column, skin, and throat.  

## IMPLANTATION

Getting an augmentation installed requires the services of a professional cybernetic surgeon or someone with ranks in Medicine equal to the level of the augmentation. A session with a cybernetic surgeon usually takes 1 hour per level of the augmentation. The price of such implantation procedures is included in the prices listed for each augmentation.  

## REMOVING AUGMENTATIONS

You might want to have an augmentation removed, usually because you want to install a different one in the same system of your body. This removal usually occurs during surgery to install new [[Cybernetics]]. [[Biotech]] usually kills off the old augmentation while it’s integrating with your body, allowing you to purge the dead [[Biotech]] naturally. Because augmentations are coded to your body, it’s not possible to resell an old augmentation, nor can you reimplant one into a different person. The price of a new augmentation includes the price and time to remove the old augmentation.  

## ACTIVATION

Most augmentations work continuously. Those requiring some degree of control are plugged into your nervous system, and you can turn them on or off as a standard action unless otherwise noted. For example, you could activate or deactivate [[Cybernetics]] in your eyes to observe different visual phenomena.
