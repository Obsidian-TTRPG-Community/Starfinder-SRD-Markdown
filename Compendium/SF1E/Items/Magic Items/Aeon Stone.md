# Aeon Stone

_Aeon stones_ are magic gemstones that orbit your head (or the nearest equivalent of a head, for species that lack heads) and grant you a constant magic effect. They do not count toward your worn magic item limit, and there’s no limit to the number you can have orbiting you. They are most common in the Azlanti Star Empire, which also has unique ways of using such stones, but the most common types of aeon stones can be found in magic shops in many major settlements. Aeon stones are categorized by their shape and color, with all stones of the same shape and color having the same magic abilities.  
  
Placing an _aeon stone_ in orbit around your head is a standard action, and removing it is a move action. An aeon stone must be in orbit for you to benefit from its abilities. The stone orbits at a distance of 3 inches to 3 feet, as you prefer, but always outside any armor or helmet you wear. An orbiting _aeon stone_ has an Armor Class equal to 12 + your character level, and it can be attacked directly or even grappled (a successful grapple check plucks the stone out of its orbit and into the attacker’s hand). Most _aeon stones_ (including all those presented here) are capable of glowing with a bright light. As a standard action, you can activate or deactivate the illumination of an aeon stone, which glows brightly enough to increase the light level in your square by one step (see Vision and Light on page 261).  
  
Each _aeon stone_ also has at least one other power that comes into effect when in orbit around you, detailed in the individual descriptions below.

Each stone of this type is keyed to a particular kind of weapon when it is created.

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 69_  
**Level**:: 4
**Price**::  2000
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

This aeon stone functions as a specialized scrying sensor that’s constantly alert for a specific trigger. Once per hour as a move action, you can task the aeon stone with watching for a specific simple stimulus such as “any Medium or larger creature,” “the sound of an approaching creature,” or “smoke.” The aeon stone constantly perceives your surroundings in a 30-foot radius with human-like senses and darkvision the stone cannot detect anything beyond that range. The stone has a +15 modifier to Life Science, Perception, or Physical Science checks to identify that assigned stimulus. If the stone senses the stimulus, it telepathically signals you, imparting information about the stimulus’s direction and distance for 1 round. The stone can provide up to three such signals per hour and no more than one per minute. The stone watches for its assigned stimulus until you deactivate the aeon stone or task it with detecting a new stimulus.

## Aeon Stone, Scarlet Prism

**Source**:: _SFS Scenario King Xeros of Star Azlant pg. 17_  
**Level**:: 4
**Price**::  2140
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

A scarlet prism aeon stone stores a single charge that it can discharge as a tiny laser beam, functioning identically to an azimuth optical laser augmentation. The aeon stone cannot be immediately recharged by spending a Resolve Point, but while its charge is spent, it provides its user with fire resistance 5 that applies only against laser attacks. When a laser attack inflicts enough damage to the user to bypass this resistance, the aeon stone immediately becomes recharged, no longer providing resistance until it is discharged again.

## Aeon Stone, Kehtarite Oval

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 69_  
**Level**:: 5
**Price**::  3000
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

Although found on other worlds, the brittle blue mineral kehtarite is named after and is especially prevalent on Kehtaria, where it’s often incorporated into fire-suppressing insulation. While this aeon stone orbits you, it inhibits nearby combustion. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to saving throws against the burning condition, and you automatically extinguish any nonmagical fires in your space or any squares you enter, to a maximum of 20 5-foot cubes per minute. When any burst or emanation that deals fire damage or has the fire descriptor (such as an incendiary grenade or explosive blast) is centered on a space or intersection within your reach, as a reaction, you can drain the aeon stone’s magic and attempt a Reflex save against the effect’s save DC (or DC 13 plus half the effect’s item level or CR if it doesn’t have a saving throw) to suppress the effect. If you succeed, you delay the effect for 1 round, after which it takes effect as normal. When drained in this way, the aeon stone provides no further benefits for 24 hours.

### Description

While this _aeon stone_ orbits you, it functions as a comm unit and a tier 3 computer with an artificial personality upgrade that you can access directly through your nervous system without needing a user interface. While the stone orbits you, you are aware of any attempt to connect to it and can grant access if you wish. This computer can be upgraded as normal, and the upgrades are all magical. The stone is magically powered, so the computer doesn’t need a power source.

**Level**:: 6
**Price**::  4200

## Aeon Stone, Lusinite Rose

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 69_  
**Level**:: 8
**Price**::  9500
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

Renowned for its iridescence, the gemstone lusinite has a dazzling quality that often sees the mineral hoarded by birds and other animals as treasures. As an aeon stone, it captivate creatures in three ways. As part of the action used to cast a spell with the charm descriptor, you can activate this aeon stone to negate any bonus to the saving throw one target might receive for being threatened or attacked by you or your allies. Second, you can activate the aeon stone as a reaction when you attempt a Charisma check to convince a charmed creature to follow your suggestions. Third, you can activate the aeon stone as a reaction when a threatening behavior by you or your allies would end the effects of your spell with the charm descriptor. The charmed creature attempts a Will save against the spell with a +5 enhancement bonus if it succeeds, it ends the spell as normal, but if it fails, that threatening action does not break the spell (though subsequent actions might do so).  
You can activate the lusinite rose twice per day, using any combination of these three effects. A creature is immune to the aeon stone’s effects if it cannot see the item.

### Description

The _kaleidoscopic icosahedron_ originated within the Azlanti Star Empire as an award given to high-ranking members of the Aeon Guard. While the stone orbits you, if you roll a d20 and you dislike the result, as a reaction you can reroll the d20 and use the better result. Alternatively, as a reaction when you are the target of an attack, you can force the attacker to reroll the d20 and use the worse result.

At the start of your next turn, you regain 1 Hit Point. After providing you this benefit, the _silver lemniscate_ can’t do so again for 24 hours, and you can’t benefit from a different _silver lemniscate_ for 24 hours.
