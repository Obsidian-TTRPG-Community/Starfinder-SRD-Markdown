# Sightless (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 155_, _Alien Archive pg. 156_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 152_, _Alien Archive 3 pg. 153_  
The creature doesn’t use any visual senses and is thus never subject to any effect that requires the creature to see a target or effect. Sightless creatures normally have some form of blindsight to compensate for their sightlessness, but if not, they’re assumed to be able to operate as well as a creature with normal vision unless the creature’s description says otherwise.

_Format_: **Senses** sightless.
