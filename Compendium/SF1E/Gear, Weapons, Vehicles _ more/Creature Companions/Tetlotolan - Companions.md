# TETLOTOLAN - COMPANIONS

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 95_  
This squat hexapod’s body has radial symmetry and resembles a starfish with tall, fern-like crests that chime softly when rustled. They filter feed on sounds, migrating slowly to absorb a varied diet.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Discordant Burst (Ex, 7th level)** Every 1d6 rounds, a tetlotolan can create a 5-foot-radius burst of unsettling harmonics within 30 feet as a standard action. Creatures in the area become flat-footed and off-target for 1 round unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the tetlotolan’s level)  
**Frond (Ex)** A tetlotolan’s frond attack targets EAC and has the unwieldy weapon property.
