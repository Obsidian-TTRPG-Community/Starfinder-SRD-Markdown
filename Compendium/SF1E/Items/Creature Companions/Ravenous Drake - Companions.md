### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Growth Spurt (Ex, 6th level)** Upon reaching 6th level, a ravenous drake can choose to become Medium. If it remains Small, each time it gains a new level it can choose to become Medium.  
**Suctioning Vortex (Ex)** As a standard action, a ravenous drake can make a special melee attack targeting KAC by powerfully inhaling, drawing its prey into its mouth. Against a target larger than the drake, this functions as the attach universal creature ability; if the attack succeeds, the drake moves to the nearest adjacent space and attaches to the target. If the attack fails, the drake moves but doesn’t attach.  
Against a target of the ravenous drake’s size or smaller, this instead functions in many ways like the swallow whole universal creature ability. The drake gains a +4 bonus to the initial attack roll but doesn’t deal damage upon initially hitting the target. On its subsequent turns, while grappling or pinning the target, the drake deals its bite damage. The drake can swallow a creature of its size or smaller. While it has swallowed a creature of its same size, the drake gains the encumbered and flat-footed conditions.  
The movement from this ability—both for the drake and its target—does not provoke attacks of opportunity. The DC of Strength checks to remove an attached drake equals 10 + the drake’s level. Use the drake’s level in place of its CR to calculate the Athletics check DC to climb out of its stomach.
