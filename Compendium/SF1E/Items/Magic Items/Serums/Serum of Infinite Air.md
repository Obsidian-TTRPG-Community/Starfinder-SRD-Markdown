### Description

This bottled quintessence from the Plane of Air is nearly invisible and adds virtually no weight to its container. For 1 hour after drinking a serum of infinite air, you don’t need to breathe and are immune to inhaled poisons. This doesn’t protect you from other effects of being in a vacuum or decompression.
