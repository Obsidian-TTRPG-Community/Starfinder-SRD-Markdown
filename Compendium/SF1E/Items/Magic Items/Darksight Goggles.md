### Description

_Darksight goggles_ are a magical innovation made to aid vision and counter magical darkness without the telltale signs created by technology, such as ultraviolet lasers. The goggles count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. While wearing these goggles, you gain low-light vision as well as darkvision with a range of 60 feet. In addition, the darkvision these goggles provide allows you to see in color. If you already have darkvision, darksight goggles increase its range by 30 feet.
