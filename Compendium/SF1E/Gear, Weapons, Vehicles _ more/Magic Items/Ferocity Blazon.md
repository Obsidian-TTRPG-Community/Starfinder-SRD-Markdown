### DESCRIPTION

A fierce reputation is a benefit, but only if your opponents know of it. Symbols on clothing have long been used to create associations between a given group’s reputation and its members. A _ferocity blazon_ is a decorated medal or tabard whose magic enhances any impression you make so that you’re better at intimidation.  
  
A _ferocity blazon_ must be worn prominently to function. While you do so, when you succeed at an Intimidate check to bully or demoralize a creature, you double the duration of the effect. If you are in the captain role on a starship, when you take the taunt action and succeed at the Bluff or Intimidate check, you double the duration that enemy crew members take a penalty to checks.
