## Description

You place a magical mark, about 1 square foot in size, on the target. When you create it, the mark can be visible, invisible, or invisible to everyone but you. A visible mark can be something electronically readable, such as a barcode. Those who can observe invisible things can observe an invisible mark. Any magic mark is apparent to someone using _detect magic_.
