This massive frame of curved metal and rippling carbon-fiber musculature resembles a quadrupedal predator, with sickle-clawed limbs and zero-edged fangs. Unlike other powered armor, a feral frame has no hands, and the control interface prevents the wearer from using their own hands for any other purpose. A feral frame includes an integrated automated loader upgrade and integrated juggernaut boosters upgrade, neither of which count against the feral frame’s carried bulk.
