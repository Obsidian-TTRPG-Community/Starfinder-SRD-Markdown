### DESCRIPTION

For those who want to use lethal weapons in nonlethal ways, an _inertial dampener_ is the tool of choice. You can activate or deactivate an _inertial dampener_ as a swift action. While the dampener is active, it creates a field around the weapon or its ammunition that causes the weapon to deal nonlethal damage in place of its regular damage.
