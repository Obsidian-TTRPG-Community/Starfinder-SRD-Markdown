Effect: You can add the _tactical_ fusion only to a ranged weapon. _Tactical_ weapons are traditionally associated with the mercenaries of the Skyfire Legion and the close bonds they often form with one another. Such weapons typically take on decorations of crossed blades, bundles of arrows, or similar sets of weaponry. When you use a _tactical_ weapon to provide covering fire or harrying fire, the bonus granted increases by 1. This ability of this fusion doesn’t stack with other abilities that increase the bonuses provided by covering fire or harrying fire.
