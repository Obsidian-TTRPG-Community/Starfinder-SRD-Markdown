# Echolocators

As a swift action, you can fan out these replacement ears to triple their surface area, giving you blindsense (sound) with a range of 30 feet. Active and enhanced echolocators occupy both the ears and throat system, also allowing you to spend a move action to produce, receive, and process a series of subsonic chirps to gain the benefits of blindsight (sound) until the beginning of your next turn. The blindsight from active echolocators has a range of 30 feet, while the blindsight from enhanced echolocators has a range of 60 feet.
