Effect: A weapon with the _synesthetic_ fusion carries a trace of the Dreamers’ psychic energies. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with this fusion, the target must succeed at a Will save or the distinctions between its senses begin to blur in a particularly disorienting fashion. For 1d3 rounds, the affected creature’s speeds are halved and it takes a –4 penalty to attack rolls, AC, Reflex saves, and skill checks. A creature affected by a synesthetic weapon is immune to this effect from the same weapon for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the _synesthetic_ effect.
