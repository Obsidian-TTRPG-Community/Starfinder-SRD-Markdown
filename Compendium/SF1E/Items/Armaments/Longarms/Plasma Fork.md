# Plasma Fork

Also known as a plasma rail gun, a plasma fork has two long metal prongs in place of a barrel. The mechanism magnetically accelerates a bolt of plasma between these two prongs, but it can also hold plasma temporarily between the prongs to charge up an even more devastating attack. Each model has a number of notches that infuse the plasma with energy, starting with 12-notch plasma forks and increasing in intensity to 15-notch, 19-notch, and 22-notch plasma forks.

### Plasma Weapons

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
