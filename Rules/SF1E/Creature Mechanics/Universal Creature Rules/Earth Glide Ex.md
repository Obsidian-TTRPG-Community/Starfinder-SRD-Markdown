# Earth Glide (EX)

**Source** _Alien Archive pg. 154_  
When the creature burrows, it can pass through dirt, stone, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water. If protected against fire damage, it can even glide through lava. Its burrowing leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence.

_Format_: **Other Abilities** earth glide.
