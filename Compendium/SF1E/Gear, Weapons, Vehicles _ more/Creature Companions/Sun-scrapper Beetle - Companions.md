# SUN-SCRAPPER BEETLE - COMPANIONS

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 27_  
Dawn beetles make agreeable companions so long as their keepers periodically remind them not to disassemble nearby vehicles and architecture. A sun-scrapper becomes anxious unless regularly provided junk and a place to store it, but properly bribed, it remains content to live with others for years. Core-divers, on the other hand, rarely remain on the surface long enough to serve as long-term companions.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Junk Fortress (Ex)** A sun-scrapper beetle gains the Barricade feat. When you’re mounted on your sun-scrapper beetle companion, you and your companion benefit equally from the cover granted by Barricade.  
**Scrap (Ex)** A sun-scrapper beetle gains a +4 racial bonus to sunder combat maneuvers.  
**Solar Slingshot (Ex)** A dawn sun-scrapper can fly through space at standard navigation and astrogation speeds (Starfinder Core Rulebook 290) using Survival instead of Piloting to navigate. The beetle can initiate this travel only while within 10 miles of an ongoing solar flare or similar stellar phenomenon. The beetle can’t fly, but while traveling and curled up, it can reliably survive crash landings, taking only 3d6 falling damage no matter the height or speed.
