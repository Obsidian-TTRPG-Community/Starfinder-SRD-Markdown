# AGILE CASTING
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 155_  
You can move, cast a spell, and move again before foes react.

**Prerequisites**: Key ability score 15, Dex 15, Mobility, caster level 4th.

**Benefit**: As a full action, you can move up to your speed and cast a single spell with a casting time of one standard action or less at any point during your movement. If you have a supernatural ability that can be activated as a standard action or less, you can instead use that ability at any point during your movement.

**Normal**: You can move only before or after casting a spell, not both.
