# Scanner

Scanners are common items that allow you to extend your senses and record your experiences. Some specialized scanners can also provide other senses, such as blindsense or sense through, but these often require ongoing monitoring or impose other restrictions. Common examples include laser microphones, motion detectors, and x-ray visors.  

## Scanner, Enhanced Camera

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 107_  
**Level**:: 3
**Price**::  1,375  
**Capacity**:: 20; **Usage** 1/hour  
**Hands**:: 1**Bulk** L

### Description

An enhanced camera functions as a video camera, but it can view a wider band of wavelengths, including infrared wavelengths. Enhanced cameras have low-light vision and darkvision with a range of 60 feet. An enhanced camera can record up to 24 hours of footage.

## Scanner, Video Camera

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 107_  
**Level** 1;
**Price**::  275  
**Capacity**:: 20; **Usage** 2/hour  
**Hands**:: 1**Bulk** L

### Description

The most typical scanner is a video camera, which requires one hand to use. A video camera has ordinary sight and is capable of seeing whatever an ordinary human could see, with up to 10 times magnification. A video camera can record up to 4 hours of footage, which can be downloaded and viewed using nearly any computer.

## Scanner, Shotgun Microphone

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 107_  
**Level** 2;
**Price**::  625  
**Capacity**:: 20; **Usage** 1/hour  
**Hands**:: 1**Bulk** L

### Description

A shotgun microphone amplifies your sense of hearing within a particular direction. You gain a +2 insight bonus to hearing-based Perception checks in a 60-foot cone, but you take a –2 penalty to hearing-based Perception checks from other areas. A shotgun microphone can record up to 12 hours of sound. You don’t need to take an action to use a shotgun microphone, but changing its direction requires a move action.

## Scanner, Laser Microphone

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 219_  
**Level** 5;
**Price**::  2,725  
**Capacity**:: 10; **Usage** 1/minute  
**Hands** 2; **Bulk** L

### Description

This handheld sensor allows you to hear through normally sound-impervious materials at great range. It grants you sense through (hearing) with a range of 120 feet, but only through materials that are 1 inch thick or thinner, and each Perception check attempted using it takes a full action, during which you are flat-footed.

## Scanner, Motion DETECTOR](HTTPS://AONSRD.COM/TECHITEMS.ASPX?ITEMNAME=MOTION%20DETECTOR&FAMILY=SCANNER)

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 219_  
**Level** 7;
**Price**::  6,000  
**Capacity**:: 10; **Usage** 1/hour  
**Hands**:: 1**Bulk** L

### Description

This handheld scanner is capable of detecting sweeping kinetic moves, such as the locomotion of creatures and vehicles. Motion detectors have blindsense (vibration) out to 30 feet, but you must take a move action each round to use the sensor.

## Scanner, True-frame Camera

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 107_  
**Level** 9;
**Price**::  12,250  
**Capacity**:: 100; **Usage** 2/hour  
**Hands**:: 1**Bulk** L

### Description

A true-frame camera functions as an enhanced camera, and it also has supplemental multispectrum programming designed to detect the slight errors in shading and lighting that are artifacts of holograms and illusions. True-frame cameras automatically shift to variant wavelengths to detect and image actual objects, identifying the holograms and illusions as such with overlay text or masking. True-frame cameras automatically identify holograms and illusions via sense through (vision), except for images that specifically fool cameras or other surveillance systems (such as _holographic image_ and _nondetection_). Trueframe cameras do not automatically detect mundane or lowtech disguises.

## Scanner, X-ray Visor

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 219_  
**Level** 9;
**Price**::  15,000  
**Capacity**:: 40; **Usage** 1/round  
**Hands** —; **Bulk** L

### Description

This sensor is worn as an adjustable viewer resting over the eyes, like goggles or thick glasses. It sends out X-rays and interprets the information gathered as an image it imposes over your normal vision. This grants sense through (vision) with a range of 60 feet, though it is blocked by materials one-fifth as dense as those that block normal sense through (2 feet of wood or plastic, 1 foot of stone, 2 inches of common metal, or 1 inch of lead or any starmetal) and limits you to black-and-white vision while in use. You don’t gain the benefit of any other special visual se
