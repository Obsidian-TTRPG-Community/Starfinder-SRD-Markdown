### Description

This smooth, thumb-sized device activates automatically when it is inside a living creature. You can implant a diagnostic lozenge subdermally in a willing or unconscious creature with a successful DC 20 Medicine check, or a creature can choose to swallow one. An activated diagnostic lozenge steers itself into a creature’s tissue and extrudes several filaments to monitor its status, broadcasting information on a predetermined wireless frequency to a designated receiver, such as a datapad or comm unit, as long as the receiver is within 1 mile of the lozenge. The diagnostic lozenge broadcasts the creature’s direction and distance relative to the receiver, as well as any of the following conditions that are affecting the creature: dead, dying, frightened, nauseated, panicked, sickened, stable, staggered, stunned, or unconscious. A single receiver can accept information from up to six different diagnostic lozenges simultaneously. When a diagnostic lozenge runs out of charges, it breaks down into harmless components that eventually pass out of the creature’s body. Diagnostic lozenges can’t normally be safely removed once activated.
