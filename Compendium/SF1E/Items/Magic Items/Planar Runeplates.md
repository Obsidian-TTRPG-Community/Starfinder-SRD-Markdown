Cultists and religious artificers forge _planar runeplates_, as do the demon-worshipping drow of Apostae. Each set of _planar runeplates_ is dedicated to a specific powerful being native to the Outer Planes, such as an archdevil, a demon lord, or a god. Devotional symbols on the plates might convince others you’re aligned with the being in question, even if you’re not. You wear the plates by affixing them to clothing or armor they count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up a number of upgrade slots equal to their mark.  
  
Each set of _planar runeplates_ has the same alignment as the extraplanar entity to which the plates are dedicated, although no plates are created with a neutral alignment with no other alignment components. While you wear the plates, they have several effects. If a creature with an alignment component opposite any of the plates’ alignment components attacks you, the plates alert you to the creature’s opposing subtypes. If the attack hits, as a reaction you can force the creature to reroll the attack and use the worse result. If you fail a saving throw against an effect created by such a creature, as a reaction you can reroll the saving throw and take the better result. Once you benefit from a given set of _planar runeplates_, you can benefit from a different set only after 24 hours have passed.  
  
_Planar runeplates_ allow a number of rerolls per day based on their model.
