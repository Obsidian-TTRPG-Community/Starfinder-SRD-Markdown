# CONTROL MODULE


The control module allows the computer to operate a complex device, to which it must be in some way connected. (Simpler devices can be controlled as part of a computer’s basic functions.)Some countermeasures might make use of a computer’s control modules when activated. Gaining control of a computer allows the user to activate the devices in any way allowed by the control module. The price of a control module depends on the complexity of the object being controlled. The control module for a more complex device, such as a spy drone, vehicle, or weapon turret, costs 10% of the device to be controlled.

When controlling a basic device that essentially has an on/off switch, the computer simply gains access to that switch and can activate or deactivate the connected device as instructed. When in charge of a device that can already operate autonomously (such as a robot or another computer), the controlling computer can give orders to that device. When operating a device that requires a skill check or attack roll (such as a computer hooked to a med-bed or weapon), the controlling computer can either allow a creature with authorized access to attempt a skill check or attack roll, or attempt the skill check or attack roll itself. When making its own check, the computer is assumed to have an attack bonus equal to its tier, proficiency with any weapon it controls, and a total skill bonus equal to 2-1/2 × its tier. Such controlled objects are normally mounted to a specific location (such as a controlled longarm placed in a turret with line of sight to the computer’s terminal), in which case the mount and related components are included in the control unit price.

A computer can also control another computer. In this case, hacking one computer allows you to attempt to hack any computer it controls, but this does not automatically give you access to those other computers. It’s common for a lower-tier computer to be set up to control a higher-tier computer, such as when a clerk’s desk computer is linked to a company mainframe. In these cases, the lower-tier computer can only send specific, authorized commands to the higher-tier computer, though it can still be used as an access point in an attempt to hack the higher-tier computer.
