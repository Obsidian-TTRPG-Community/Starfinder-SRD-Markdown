### Description

The sharp edge of a grindblade has been crafted with advanced micropitting technology that turns it into a destructive rasp at close to the molecular level, capable of inflicting hideous damage. So sharp and savage is their edge that most grindblade designers donâ€™t even bother giving them a point.
