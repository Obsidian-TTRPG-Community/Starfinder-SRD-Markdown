### Description

Developed by the Academy of Purpose on New Thespera, iridium stars see everyday use throughout the Azlanti Star Empire’s Imperial Fleet as an atmospheric bailout safety measure. You can activate this aeon stone once per day as a reaction when you’re in a vacuum, zero-g environment, or both. Once activated, the aeon stone grants you immunity to cosmic rays, immunity to the environmental effects of vacuum, the ability to go without breathing, and a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability) that works only in a vacuum or zero-g environment. This effect lasts for 1 hour.
