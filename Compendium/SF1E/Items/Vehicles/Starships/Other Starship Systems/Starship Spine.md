# Starship Spine

Starship spines are a combination of rigid spikes, jagged blades, and long spines that can fend off nearby starships and creatures. When a starship outfitted with starship spines is rammed by another vessel or struck by an attack whose maximum range is 1 hex, that vessel provokes a free attack with the spines from the starship. The spines are a starship weapon that require no mount
they can attack any arc, can’t be used to make any other attacks, and deal damage based on the spines’ mark. Depending on their size, some spines can only be installed on starships of a minimum size.
