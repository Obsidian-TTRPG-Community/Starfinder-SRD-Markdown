desc:: You can use this gear boost before attempting to fire a ranged weapon that is out of ammunition to immediately reload the weapon with an amount of ammunition or charge equal to the weapon’s usage value. This can’t provide a weapon additional ammunition if the ammunition’s item level is greater than half your soldier level. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.
