Uplifted bears can charge at their foes to knock them down. This augmentation strengthens the muscles in your extremities and allows you to attempt a trip combat maneuver in place of a normal melee attack at the end of a charge. In addition, you can charge without taking the normal penalties to your attack roll or AC. If you have another ability that allows you to charge without taking these penalties (such as the charge attack ability from the soldier’s blitz fighting style), you also gain the ability to charge through difficult terrain.
