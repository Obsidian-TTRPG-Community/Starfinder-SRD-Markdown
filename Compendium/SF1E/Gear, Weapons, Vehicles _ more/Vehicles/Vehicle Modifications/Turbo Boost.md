# TURBO BOOST
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 83_
**Price** 6,500  
**CAPACITY** 20; **USAGE** 5  
  
This optimized power source can grant temporary bursts of speed. The pilot can activate the turbo boost as part of a drive, race, ram, run over, keep pace, or speed up action, increasing the vehicle’s speed by 10 feet, increasing its full speed by 100 feet, and granting a +1 circumstance bonus to the pilot’s checks to perform the keep pace or speed up actions. In addition, the vehicle’s attack modifiers decrease by 2. These effects last until the start of the pilot’s next turn.
