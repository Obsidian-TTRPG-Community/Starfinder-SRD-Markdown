# Irokiroi, Oshirokiroi

Though most inhabitants of the Liavaran moon of Osoro remain confined to the few mountain peaks rising above the roiling cloud-seas of toxic gases, these perilous clouds are home to their own seldom-seen and poorly understood jungle ecosystem. The apex predators of this system are irokirois, huge serpentine creatures with long wing fins that spiral in a helical pattern along their entire bodies, from their razorfanged tripartite maws to their tapered tails. Though most irokirois keep to the toxic gas seas, their corkscrewing flight occasionally brings them to the surface or even to the skies above to attack Osoran settlements in furious rages.

Irokirois are largely solitary creatures. Roughly twice every year, they congregate in writhing coils of up to a dozen to mate, after which each gives birth to dozens of tiny young. These offspring spiral to the bottom of the cloud seas and drill into the ground, where they feed until their wing fins develop. An irokiroi continues to grow throughout its lifespan, and one that survives long enough eventually grows into an enormous predator with the capacity to wreak great destruction; Osorans call these immense apex predators oshirokirois.

In recent years, irokiroi and oshirokiroi attacks have increased drastically, with some Osoran settlements fighting off multiple instances each month. A strong correlation exists between the rise in attacks and the growing popularity of Bhalakosti Excursion’s survival safari trips into the moon’s poisonous jungles, run by dirindi (see pages 20–21) natives of the moon and patronized by predominantly vesk customers. Though the company’s representatives have declined to comment on the situation, biologists theorize that the excursions’ hunting of predators that feed on immature irokirois has led to a surge in the irokiroi population and therefore more attacks.

### Special Abilities

**Anharmonic Hum (Ex)** The wing membranes of an oshirokiroi vibrate with a series of anharmonic frequencies. A creature that enters or starts its turn within 30 feet of an oshirokiroi takes 3d4 sonic damage (Fortitude DC 19 half).

**Breath Weapon (Ex)** When not within the gas seas of Osoro, an oshirokiroi can expel extra gas stored in its gas bladder as a standard action, dealing acid damage and exposing creatures in the area to Osoran roil poison. An oshirokiroi can use this breath weapon only once each time it emerges from the gas seas; reentering the gas sea refreshes this ability.

**Death Throes (Ex)** When an oshirokiroi is killed, its gas bladder loses cohesion and explodes in a burst of high-frequency sound and toxic gases. Each creature within 20 feet of the oshirokiroi takes 6d6 sonic damage and is deafened for 1d4 rounds; with a successful DC 19 Fortitude save, a creature takes half the damage and negates the deafened effect. The area in a radius of 50 feet from the oshirokiroi becomes a dense cloud of toxic fumes that provide concealment. A creature that enters or starts its turn in the cloud takes 4d4 acid damage and is exposed to Osoran roil poison. The cloud can be dispersed in the same way as _fog cloud_ and otherwise dissipates on its own in 1 minute.

**Sonic Burst (Ex)** An oshirokiroi’s sonic burst is a high-frequency screech that can target a single creature within 40 feet. In addition, an oshirokiroi’s sonic burst has the deafen critical hit effect (DC 19).

**Topple (Ex)** If an irokiroi’s bite attack hits the target’s KAC + 4, the irokiroi deals its normal damage and automatically trips the target (this takes no action).

**Type** poison (inhaled); **Save** Fortitude DC 19  
**Track** Constitution; **Onset** 1 minute; **Frequency** 1/minute for 6 minutes
