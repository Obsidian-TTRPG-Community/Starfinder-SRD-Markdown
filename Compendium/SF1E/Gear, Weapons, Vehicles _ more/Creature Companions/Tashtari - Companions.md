# TASHTARI - COMPANIONS

**Source** _Alien Archive 3 pg. 145_  
Nicknamed “laser wolves,” tashtaris are covered in a twinkling phosphorescent coat that they can use to communicate and power their muzzle beams. Domesticated tashtaris are less dangerous than their wild counterparts, but they can still be potent threats on the battlefield.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Diverting Coat (Ex)** If your tashtari companion is within 30 feet of you at the beginning of your turn, you can attempt a new saving throw against any fascination effects currently affecting you without taking an action. If the new saving throw is successful, the fascination effect ends. This has no effect on abilities that do not allow saving throws.

**Muzzle Beam (Ex, 7th level)** Every 1d4 rounds, a tashtari can unleash a focused ray of light as a ranged attack that targets EAC. This ray has a range increment of 80 feet and the burn critical hit effect.
