### Description

Injection gloves were originally designed for medical use, but they have been heavily altered to serve in combat as well. A flat cartridge containing an injectable substance (such as a medicinal or poison) is inserted into a slot in the pointer finger of the glove, where it connects with a retractable needle. When the pointer finger encounters resistance, the needle pops out and injects its contents. The needle is reset by pressing it against a hard surface (which can be done as part of reloading it).
