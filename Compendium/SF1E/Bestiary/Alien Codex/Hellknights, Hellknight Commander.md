# HELLKNIGHTS, HELLKNIGHT COMMANDER
Hellknights preserve law and order at any cost. They coordinate their efforts from massive citadel-ships, but most of their forces are deployed in smaller groups to handle minor disruptions. Different orders have different focuses and different methods, but they all share many commonalities. Hellknights might seek to brutally punish criminals and pirates, crush uprisings against stabilizing authorities (no matter how unreasonable or unpopular those authorities might be), or forcibly “civilize” frontiers they perceive as unruly.

### ECOLOGY

## DESCRIPTION

Hellknight commanders lead missions and determine how subordinate Hellknights should handle unexpected circumstances. They negotiate with authorities to determine their purview in a system with an organized government. Without a government to restrain them, Hellknight commanders take it upon themselves to institute their own merciless vision of order, regardless of the wishes of any folk who happen to already be there.  
Hellknight commanders are accustomed to unquestioning obedience. As a result, they have little patience for rabble-rousers and are quick to condemn anyone who questions their methods without a sound legal argument. Many Hellknight commanders take pride in their ability to turn any combat into an opportunity for an object lesson to their troops.  
**Adaptation:** A Hellknight commander can function as an exceptionally disciplined and militaristic mid-level Steward leader. Alternatively, a Hellknight commander can be the fierce captain of a warship.
