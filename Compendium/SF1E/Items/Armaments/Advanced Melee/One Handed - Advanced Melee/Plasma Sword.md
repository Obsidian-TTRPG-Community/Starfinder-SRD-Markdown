A plasma generator is seated within this swordâ€™s hilt. A plasma-resistant ceramic housing focuses the beam with the assistance of a localized force field, either in a single straight beam or along a magnetized blunted blade or wire-like lines. When the sword is unpowered, the plasma beam disappears.

# Plasma Weapons

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
