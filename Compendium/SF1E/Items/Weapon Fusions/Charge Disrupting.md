Effect: A weapon with the charge disrupting fusion disrupts power sources. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the _charge disrupting_ fusion, either the target or a single visible object carried by the target is subject to _discharge_, as the spell. The target creature (or its bearer, in the case of an object) can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect, as normal. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the _charge disrupting_ effect.
