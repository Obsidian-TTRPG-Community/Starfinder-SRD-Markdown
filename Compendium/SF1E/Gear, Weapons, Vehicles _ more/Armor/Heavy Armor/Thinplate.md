### DESCRIPTION

Devised by androids, thinplate is a dense polyethylene layer that looks lightweight while providing significant protection. This type of heavy armor is thin enough to be worn under loose outfits, but the rigid polyethylene restricts movement and slows the wearer. Thinplate can be molded into a variety of styles, though a simple breastplate plus limb guards is the most common form.
