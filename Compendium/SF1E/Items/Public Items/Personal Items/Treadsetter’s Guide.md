### Description

Countless travel guides promise the greatest getaways in the galaxy, yet the Treadsetter’s brand is so ubiquitous (and sufficiently accurate) as to be synonymous with travel literature. Each Treadsetter’s guide comes in physical and digital formats, corresponding to a specific planet, large moon, or other habitable astronomical object like an asteroid belt. There are hundreds of thousands of these volumes, representing most known and noteworthy worlds. By spending 1 minute referencing the guide while studying cultures, features, or creatures from its corresponding world, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Culture, Life Sciences, and Physical Sciences checks to recall knowledge and identify creatures.
