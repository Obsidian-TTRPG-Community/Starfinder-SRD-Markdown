name:: Mindless (EX)
source:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 154_, _Alien Archive pg. 155_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 151_, _Alien Archive 3 pg. 152_  
desc:: The creature has no Intelligence score or modifier and is immune to mind-affecting effects. Any DCs or other statistics that rely on an Intelligence score treat the creature as having a score of 10 (+0).

_Format_: **Other Abilities** mindless.  
_Guidelines_: Mindless creatures usually have fewer good skills and no master skills. Their skills should be based on inborn abilities, since theyâ€™re incapable of training.
