# Polyphonic Buffer

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 85_  
**Item Level** 9;
**Price**::  13,200; **System** Skin  
Designed from a synthetic protoplasm that deadens and bends sonic vibrations, this skin graft gives you sonic resistance 5. In addition, you can activate the graft to emit constant, erratic vibrations that interfere with blindsense (sound) and blindsight (sound). While activated, creatures can detect you with blindsense (sound) at only one-third the normal range, whereas creatures with blindsight (sound) gain only the benefits of blindsense when detecting you. The graft remains activated for 5 minutes or until deactivated, after which it can’t be activated again until you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.
