# Discern Lies

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 349_  
**Classes**:: Mystic 4, Precog 4  
**School**:: divination  
**Casting-Time**:: 1 standard action  
**Range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Targets**:: up to one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart  
**Duration**:: concentration, up to 1 round/level  
**Saving-Throw**:: Will negates
**Spell Resistance**:: No

## Description

Each round, you concentrate on one target within range. You know if the target deliberately and knowingly speaks a lie by discerning disturbances in its aura caused by lying. The spell does not reveal the truth or uncover unintentional inaccuracies, and it doesnâ€™t necessarily reveal evasions. Each round, you can concentrate on a different target.
