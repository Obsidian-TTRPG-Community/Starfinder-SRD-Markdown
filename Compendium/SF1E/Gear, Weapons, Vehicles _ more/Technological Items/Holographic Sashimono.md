### DESCRIPTION

This lightweight, shoulder-mounted hologram projector displays the image of a banner or crest in the air above and slightly behind you. Some use these to broadcast their beliefs, while others employ them as personal advertisements. Most holographic sashimonos display images up to 2 feet wide and 3 feet tall, and these images can be programmed to be static (such as a military insignia) or short looping animations (such as roaring flames). A holographic sashimono grants you a +2 insight bonus to Profession checks to earn a living.
