**Speed** 4; **Maneuverability** perfect (turn 0); **Drift** —  
**AC** 30; **TL** 27  
**HP** 640; **DT** 5; **CT** 128  
**Shields** 400 (forward 100, port 100, starboard 100, aft 100)

### Crew

**Engineer (1 action)** Engineering +31 (18 ranks)  
**Gunners (5 actions)** gunnery +26 (18th level)  
**Pilot (1 action)** Piloting +28 (18 ranks)  
**Science Officer (1 action)** Computers +36 (18 ranks)

### Ecology

**Environment** any vacuum  
**Organization** solitary

### Special Abilities

**Intelligence Drain (Su)** Once per combat, instead of taking actions during the engineering phase, a cerebrex can force up to five creatures on a starship within 7 hexes of it to each attempt a DC 25 Will saving throw, taking 2 Intelligence damage on a failure. The cerebrex regains 50 Hull Points for every creature that fails this check. This is a mind-affecting effect.  
  
**Living Starship (Ex)** A cerebrex is a spacefaring ooze so immense it functions as a starship (and thus engages only in starship combat). It has no crew, but it can still take engineer, gunner, pilot, and science officer actions using the bonuses, level, and ranks listed above. Modifiers for its size, speed, and maneuverability are already factored into its statistics. Use the following table to determine the effects when a cerebrex takes critical damage.

| D%     | SYSTEM        | EFFECT                                                                                                            |
|--------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–30   | Weapons array | Randomly determine one arc containing weapons; condition applies to all gunner actions using weapons in that arc. |
| 31–60  | Propulsion    | Condition applies to all pilot actions.                                                                           |
| 61–90  | Pseudopods    | Condition applies to all engineer actions, except when patching or repairing the pseudopods.                      |
| 91–100 | Nucleus†      | During the next round, each of the cerebrex’s attempted actions has a 25% chance of failure.                      |


† A cerebrex’s nucleus doesn’t gain critical damage conditions.

## Description

From afar, a cerebrex looks like a distant constellation of stars connected by glowing, fiery tethers—but this immense ooze is no stationary star system. Rather, cerebrexes are sentient, space-dwelling oozes that are relatively intelligent. These gargantuan creatures travel the galaxy in search of clusters of sapient life to feast upon. But sapience is more than just a tantalizing beacon for a cerebrex; this ooze has evolved the strange ability to metabolize both the physical matter of its food and a fragment of its prey’s sapience.  
  
After feasting on entire civilizations, a cerebrex briefly takes on an almost-humanoid intelligence—just long enough to plan its next attack and map the way to the next-closest cluster of civilized life. This spark of intelligence is fleeting, though, and as the ooze digests its meal completely, the inherited intelligence also fades. By the time the cerebrex makes it to the next planet, it has only a vague idea of why it traveled there, but its ability to sense intelligence from thousands of miles away means its next spark of sapience is never too far off.
