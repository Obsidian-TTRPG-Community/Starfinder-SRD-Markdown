# Filament Mesh

A network of tashtari filaments implanted under the topmost layers of your skin allows you to harness and release energy from solar radiation. As a standard action, provided you have spent 4 hours of the past 24-hour period in bright light or direct sunlight, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to cause your filaments to glow with intense light. Any creature (other than you) that can see this light and is within 60 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Constitution modifier) or be dazzled for 1d4 rounds. Mk 2 filament mesh causes all creatures that fail the Fortitude save to instead be blinded for 1d4 rounds. When exposed to bright light, filament mesh is faintly visible as a reflective tracery under your skin. This augmentation can’t absorb or release light if your skin is completely covered with protective gear that doesn’t allow light through. You must have armor adjusted to accommodate this augmentation. Normal clothing allows enough solar radiation through to charge the augmentation.
