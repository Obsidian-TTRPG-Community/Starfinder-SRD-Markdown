# PARABOLAS REVIVALIST

Across the universe, sapient species have independently discovered the societal benefits of friendly (and not-so-friendly) competitionâ€”as well as the fame and fortune that can be made by widely broadcasting such competitions to die-hard fans. While some cultures thrive on intellectual games of skill and strategy, others revel in fast-paced displays of martial might, brute strength, or deadly struggle. No matter the culture, those who succeed in these displays of wit and brawn can amass quite a bit of wealth, cultural clout, and even interplanetary notoriety.  
Sports figures are direct and to-the-point combatants with a focus on physicality, dexterity, or brute force, and they can easily serve in any role where violence is a means to an end. Re-skinned sports figures might serve as flashy mercenaries, daring pirates, specially trained guards, or hired muscle.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Gravitic Agility (Su)** By making micro-adjustments to their personal gravity, parabolas revivalists can perform impressive feats of acrobatic prowess, even going airborne for short periods of time. While attuned, a parabolas revivalist gains a bonus to Acrobatics checks equal to one-third their CR. While fully attuned, a parabolas revivalist gains the ferocious charge universal creature rule and a fly speed of 30 feet when charging; after they use ferocious charge, they immediately become unattuned.

## DESCRIPTION

When a recent Starfinder Society expedition to the copaxi planet Tabrid Minor uncovered the lost rules to a forgotten sport called parabolas, copaxi anthropologists and sports enthusiasts were electrified by the discovery. Today, following reconstructed rules, parabolas revivalists throughout the galaxy attempt to recreate it, rekindle popular interest in the pastime, and develop the skills of gravitational mastery required by the demanding acrobatic, gravity-bending sport.
