# EMPATH
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 85_  
Your connection helps you sense emotions and notice details others can’t. You might be a diplomat, an investigator, a mind-reading bodyguard, a ship’s psychologist, or a psychic con artist.

**Associated Deities**: Abadar, Hylax, Iomedae, Sarenrae, Talavet, Triune (Casandalee)  
**Associated Skills**: Perception and Sense Motive  
**Spells**: 1st - _Detect Thoughts_, 2nd - _Zone of Truth_, 3rd - _Clairaudience/clairvoyance_, 4th - _Mind Probe_, 5th - _Telepathy_, 6th - _True Seeing_

## EMPATHY (SU) - 1ST LEVEL

As a full action, you can attempt a Sense Motive check to read the emotions of a particular creature (DC = 20 or 10 + its Bluff modifier, whichever is higher). If you succeed, you learn its general disposition and attitude toward creatures within 30 feet of it, and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Bluff, Diplomacy, Intimidate, and Sense Motive checks against that creature for 1 hour. Whether you succeed or fail, after opening your mind to read emotions, you take a –2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for 1 minute.  

## GREATER MINDLINK (SU) - 3RD LEVEL

You can use your mindlink ability on the same creature as many times per day as you wish, and the communication can be both ways, though the maximum of 10 minutes of communication per round still applies.  

## EMOTIONSENSE (SU) - 6TH LEVEL

You can detect and locate creatures within 60 feet that have emotions, as if you had blindsense (emotion); see page 262. A creature can keep its emotions calm to avoid detection by this ability by succeeding at a Bluff check with a DC equal to 10 + your Sense Motive modifier, but a creature under the influence of an emotion effect cannot try to avoid detection. Creatures under the effects of _nondetection_ or similar effects automatically avoid detection by this ability. Unless otherwise stated, constructs and creatures with Intelligence scores of 2 or lower don’t have emotions and can’t be sensed this way.  

## DISCERN LIES (SP) - 9TH LEVEL

You can use _discern lies_ as a spell-like ability a number of times per day equal to your mystic level, each time targeting a single creature. This effect lasts 1 round. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this ability for 24 hours.  

## GREATER EMOTIONSENSE (SU) - 12TH LEVEL

Your emotionsense is far more discerning, as if you had blindsight (emotion); see page 262.  

## RETROCOGNITION (SP) - 15TH LEVEL

You can use _retrocognition_ as a spell-like ability at will. When doing so, you take a –2 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects for as long as you concentrate on _retrocognition_ and an equal amount of time afterward. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to negate this penalty.  

## EMPATHIC MASTERY (SP) - 18TH LEVEL

You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use _psychic surgery_ as a spell-like ability. If you are incapacitated by an effect that _psychic surgery_ could remove and have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this ability on yourself, even without being able to take any actions.
