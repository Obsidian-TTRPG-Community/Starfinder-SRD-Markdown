## Description

You create an illusion of a complex maze that creatures in the area perceive. The maze matches the terrain and decor of the area it’s cast in. Those within it perceive walls, doors, barriers, twists, turns, and constant, confusing obstructions. The maze prevents creatures from perceiving any creature farther than 10 feet away from them, and makes it impossible for them to move except by taking guarded steps. If an affected creature is in a complex, mazelike area when this spell is cast, they can’t attempt a saving throw against it until they have some reason to believe they aren’t in a normal maze (normally requiring interacting with the maze in some way, such as trying to map it out or use sensors to find a way through it). Creatures that succeed at a Will save against the spell realize the maze is illusory but are still bombarded with false sensory data as they deal with the fake turns and twists around them. These targets choose at the beginning of their turn to be flat-footed or off-target, but they don’t suffer any other effects of the spell.  
At the end of each turn, characters affected by this spell can attempt a new Will save; if successful, they’re immune to this spell for 24 hours.  
Nuars are immune to the effects of this spell.
