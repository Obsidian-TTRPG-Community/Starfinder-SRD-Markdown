Type: General Feat
Prerequisites: Piloting 2 ranks.
Benefit: When performing a race action with a vehicle, you can attempt a Piloting check (DC = 15 + your vehicle’s item level) to drift, changing the heading of the vehicle at the end of the race movement up to 90 degrees. If you succeed at the check by 5 or more, you can change the heading of the vehicle by up to 180 degrees from its initial heading.  
In addition, when you force a vehicle to race unsafely, you can roll twice for the Piloting check and take the better result. If you still fail this check, you stop short (as the pilot action), changing the vehicle’s heading up to 90 degrees rather than crashing or spinning out.
