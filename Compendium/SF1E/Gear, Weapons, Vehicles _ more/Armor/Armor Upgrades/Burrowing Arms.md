# BURROWING ARMS
This armor upgrade became popular for adventurers who needed to traverse the Plane of Earth, which can frequently require excavation. It consists of modifications to the arms that allow you to quickly move dirt and other loose material, granting a burrow speed. Unless otherwise stated, burrowing arms can’t be used to burrow through solid rock or metal. This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.
