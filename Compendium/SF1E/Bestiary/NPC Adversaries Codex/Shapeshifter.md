# SHAPESHIFTER
Infiltrators are skilled at sneaking in and out of restricted places. Although different types of infiltrators may have similar goals, their methods for avoiding or compromising guards and security measures differ greatly: shapeshifters rely on their ability to become someone else, spies are masters of remaining undetected, hackers can easily break into both physical locations and computer systems to steal information, and double agents are trained to maintain a cover and lie about their allegiances.  
In adventures, infiltrators are most often encountered as antagonists who are planning to break into a secure facility to carry out acts of espionage or sabotage or to exfiltrate prisoners. Depending on the type of gig in question, infiltrators may work with assassins or thieves

### ECOLOGY

## DESCRIPTION

One of the most insidious types of infiltrators, a shapeshifter can impersonate almost anyone, hiding in plain sight to gain access to restricted data or locations. They could be the android summoned to repair workstations, the serious vesk security guard who checks everyoneâ€™s clearance upon entrance, or the driven drow CEO who wants to hear more about the newest prototype weapon. Shapeshifters are also highly trained killers who must often dispose of the people whose identities they steal. They carry only equipment they can easily hide, taking everything else they might need from their victims.
