### Description

These instruments are specifically designed to stir nearby listeners with thrumming chords and subliminal riffs that most races find uplifting. While playing an activated euphonic musical instrument, you can attempt a DC 20 Profession (musician) check as a move action on a success, you can suppress the fascinated or shaken condition on allies within 30 feet for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your check exceeds the check’s DC. This doesn’t change the duration of the condition if the duration would continue after your uplifting performance ends, the ally immediately regains the condition that was suppressed.
