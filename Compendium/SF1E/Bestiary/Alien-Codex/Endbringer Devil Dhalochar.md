### Special Abilities

**Cargo Cavity (Ex)** A dhalochar has a sizable cavity within its body. This space can comfortably fit eight Large or smaller creatures (or four Huge creatures). Any creature inside is protected from the external environment, no matter how hostile, and can breathe as normal. A dhalochar has control over what enters and what leaves its cargo cavity. Entering or leaving a willing dhalochar requires a full action, during which the dhalochar cannot move. Creatures cannot enter an uncooperative dhalochar, but they can try to escape from inside as if they were attempting to escape being grappled.

Alternatively, some dhalochars have this cavity replaced with a device capable of generating minor passages to Hell. This grants them the ability to cast 6th-level _planar binding_ as a spell-like ability once per hour (to a maximum number of times per day equal to the dhalochar’s Constitution modifier—nine times per day for most dhalochars), except they can call only devils. Called devils aren’t trapped by this ability, and they aren’t forced to do the dhalochar’s bidding, though they are usually friendly to the dhalochar.

**Construct Form (Ex)** Despite being true devils, dhalochars have a number of immunities common to constructs. They are immune to ability damage, ability drain, death effects, disease, energy drain, exhaustion, fatigue, necromancy effects, negative levels, nonlethal damage, paralysis, sleep, and stunning.

**Hellfire Glare (Ex)** As an attack, a dhalochar can shoot hellfire from its eyes at a single target. This attack has a range increment of 120 feet. The glare acts as if it had the _unholy_ fusion.

## Description

For countless eons, Hell’s legions have undermined the Material Plane, subtly corrupting mortal empires and laying waste to entire worlds. The malebranche—diabolical generals advancing hellish agendas on terrestrial fronts—call upon the planes’ most fearsome agents to claim strategic footholds. Some of these campaigns call for truly terrifying displays of force. Thus, when the lords of Hell seek to make a whole world shudder, dhalochars take to the battlefield.

Known as endbringer devils, dhalochars are forged to embody diabolical conquest. They are vessels and weapons of ruin, designed to create beachheads upon even the best-defended worlds. Dhalochars were made to withstand the depths of space and can traverse the void, stalking worlds like apocalyptic meteors. Any witnesses who survive a dhalochar’s devastating crash landing swiftly realize that the titan’s assault has only just begun.

Within its body, each dhalochar houses a cavity capable of holding a deadly payload—an infernal strike force or a portal-generating organ. This space isn’t magical but is well protected, able to withstand any attack as long as the devil remains alive. As dhalochars are close cousins to levalochs, they most commonly transport these deadly infernal shock troops.

Upon landing on a world, dhalochars release their cargo and reconfigure themselves. In their terrestrial forms, they appear as many-legged titans, a form which readily demonstrates that they are not mere machines of war. They are calmly arrogant and quick to pronounce a world’s inevitable destruction. While dhalochars participating in a major planetary assault might crash-land in heavily populated areas and immediately attack, most favor staying undiscovered so they can gradually conjure more devils in preparation for even greater diabolical offensives. Dhalochars have no ability to launch themselves into space. As a result, after a dhalochar in starship form uses its cataclysm ability, it returns to Hell using its _plane shift_ spell-like ability and waits to be conjured back to space.

A dhalochar stands roughly 90 feet tall and weighs approximately 400 tons.

## Endbringer Devil Starship Statistics

Dhalochars are equally capable of engaging with enemies in melee and in starship combat. Dhalochars have no crews or computer systems. Their other “systems” aren’t truly systems at all, but infernal approximations; the common models they imitate are listed here. Dhalochars use the following statistics when doing battle with foes in space.  

## Endbringer Devil (STARSHIP FORM) - Tier 14

**Other Abilities** cargo cavity, devil starship, no breath

### Special Abilities

**Cargo Cavity (Ex)** See above.  
**Cataclysm (Ex)** A dhalochar in starship form can crashland on a planet, space station, or similar object (as long as that object is at least 10 times the devil’s size). This devastating landing deals 15d6+25 bludgeoning damage (no save) to creatures and objects in the area where the devil lands (a 30-foot-by-30-foot square) and 6d12+28 bludgeoning damage to all creatures and objects within 50 feet of the landing space (Reflex DC 24 half). If the dhalochar crash-lands on a planet with an atmosphere, the heat of entry adds 10d6 fire damage to the damage dealt. After using this ability, a dhalochar is stunned for 1d4 rounds and then transforms into its terrestrial form.  
**Devil Starship (Ex)** A dhalochar in starship form is still a living creature, though it engages only in starship combat. It has no crew, though it can still take engineer, gunner, pilot, and science officer actions using the skill bonuses listed above. Assume it has 14 ranks in the Computers, Engineering, and Piloting skills and a base attack bonus of +14. It ignores critical damage effects that affect life support, and critical damage effects that would be applied to the crew are applied to a random creature or object in the devil’s cargo cavity.
