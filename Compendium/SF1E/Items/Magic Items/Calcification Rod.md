### Description

Kalos of the Brethedan moon of Kalo-Mahoi have developed numerous magical innovations honoring their artistic traditions. They created _calcification rods_, idealistically, to perfectly preserve objects of natural history that might otherwise rot away. Such rods see use well beyond Kalo-Mahoi, whether by scholars of natural history or those with less scrupulous aims. An authentic Kalo-Mahoian _calcification rod_ is a rough shaft of coral that glows at the end that touches a chosen target.  
  
As a standard action, you can touch a _calcification rod_ to a nonmagical object made of once-living matter, including a corpse. If the object fits into a 10-foot cube, it must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 14 + your key ability score modifier) or turn to stone. If a creature holds or wears the target object, that creature can use its own Fortitude save bonus in place of the object’s.  
  
Alternatively, you can use the rod as a club (which counts as magic for the purpose of bypassing DR), or you can attempt to touch a creature with the rod by making an attack against its EAC. If your attack hits a creature that is living or made of once-living matter, the target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (at the same DC) or move one step further along the Dexterity poison track. While under this effect, a creature can attempt a new saving throw at the end of its turn each round, curing the affliction with one successful save. A creature that would reach the dead state is instead affected as if it had failed its saving throw against a _flesh to stone_ spell, except it can attempt a new saving throw once every 24 hours to end the affliction.  
  
Any target that is immune to petrification is immune to this rod’s effects.
