# CONDUCTIVE CARRIER
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 58_  
**Item Level** 13; **Price** 51,000; **System** Lungs and Throat  
Your respiratory system manufactures nanites that specialize in conducting and channeling electrical energy. As a standard action, you can breathe these nanites into a 10-foot burst with a range of 20 feet. The nanites remain airborne and active in the area for 1 minute, though a moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the nanites in 4 rounds, and a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the nanites in 1 round. As a reaction when you or an ally makes an attack that deals electricity damage to a single target in the nanites’ area, you can activate the nanites to have the attack instead affect all creatures in the nanites’ area, resolved as though the attack had the explode weapon special property. Alternatively, you can activate the nanites as a reaction when an effect with the electricity descriptor includes the nanites in its area, adding the nanites’ area to the triggering effect’s area of effect. Either use destroys these nanites.  
After you create a cloud of nanites with this augmentation, you can’t do so again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 2 Resolve Points at any point to recharge it immediately.
