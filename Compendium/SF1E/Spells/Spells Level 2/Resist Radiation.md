## DESCRIPTION

You protect targets from radiation. They succeed at saving throws against low radiation and radiation sickness with a DC of 13 or lower. If the target has radiation sickness with a saving throw DC of 13 or lower, the sicknessâ€™s effects are suppressed for the duration. Against radiation and radiation sickness with higher save DCs, this spell instead grants targets a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throws.
