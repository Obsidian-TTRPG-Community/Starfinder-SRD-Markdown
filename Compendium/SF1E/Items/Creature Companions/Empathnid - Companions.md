# EMPATHNID - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 143_  
Originally discovered by Pact Worlds explorers on a jungle planet in the Vast, empathnids are available in a staggering array of colors and have become popular pets. The 8-inch spiders are most notable for their almost supernatural empathy for other creatures, and their venom has a stabilizing effect on most creatures.

level:: 1-10

Diminutive vermin  
**Senses** blindsense (emotion) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Moral Support (Ex)** While your empathnid companion is sharing your space, you gain a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against emotion and pain effects.

**Stabilizing Venom (Ex, 4th level)** Once per day as a standard action, an empathnid can inject its venom into a dying creature in its space, automatically stabilizing that creature. If you are dying, your empathnid companion can use actions as though you were consciously directing it, but only to attempt to stabilize you.
