# Bleeding Injection 
(Ex; 7th Level)
source: Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 26
Weapons you wield that have the injection weapon special property gain bleed 1d4 as a critical hit effect. If the weapon already has the injection critical hit effect, you can apply both effects when you score a critical hit. If the weapon has another critical hit effect, apply either the weaponâ€™s normal critical hit effect or this bleed effect. The bleed damage increases to 2d4 at 11th level, 3d4 at 15th level, and 4d4 at 19th level.
