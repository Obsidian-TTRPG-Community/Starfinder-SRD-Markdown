### Description

When you purchase a planar suit, choose one plane: astral, elemental (air, earth, fire, or water), ethereal, negative energy, positive energy, or shadow. This spacesuit (Core Rulebook 231), designed for surviving and traveling in its designated plane, grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to skill checks and saving throws related to surviving that plane’s environmental dangers.
