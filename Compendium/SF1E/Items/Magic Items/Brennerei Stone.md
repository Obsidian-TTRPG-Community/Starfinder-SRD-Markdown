This small, smooth stone glows with a pale light that sheds dim light in a 20-foot radius around you. Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes focusing on the _brenneri stone_ to gain an additional effect; this doesn’t count as resting to regain Stamina Points. After you use the stone, the radius of its light effect is reduced to 5 feet for 24 hours. You can gain the benefits of only one _brenneri stone_ per day. Brenneris can use their favored object racial trait with a _brenneri stone_ and gain the benefits of both the item and the class feature.
