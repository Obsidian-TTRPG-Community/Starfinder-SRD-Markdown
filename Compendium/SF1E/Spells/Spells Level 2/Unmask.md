## Description

Embri cast this spell to shame other embri who break decorum, and precogs manifest this spell by revealing a creature's true future appearance. If the target fails the saving throw, nonmagical disguises or face coverings fall away harmlessly, revealing the creature's face or otherwise showing its real identity. A shapechanger must revert to its true form. A creature can't successfully disguise itself, change its shape, or use a magic item to alter its appearance again for 10 minutes. During this time, the creature can't be the target of another's attempt at a nonmagical disguise, but it can be the target of another's disguising magic.

If, when you cast this spell, the effect disguising a creature is magical (other than a shapechanger's capabilities), you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level). The DC equals 11 + the level, item level, or CR of the effect's creator. If you succeed, the magic is dispelled and can't be renewed for 10 minutes. This spell has no effect on artifacts or deities.
