## DESCRIPTION

A sleeve of ice encases your striking limb. Attempt a melee attack against the target's EAC. On a hit, the target takes 10d8 cold damage and moves at half speed for the duration. You can also attempt a free grapple check, adding the higher of your key ability modifier or your Strength modifier to the attack roll, and an additional +4 from the ice. Encasing ice also increases the DC to escape your grapple by 4. Each round the target remains grappled, it takes 4d8 cold damage.

Casting this spell doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
