## DESCRIPTION

This spell turns corpses into undead creatures that obey your spoken commands. The undead can be made to follow you, or they can be made to remain in place and attack any creature (or a specific kind of creature) entering the area. They remain animated until they are destroyed. A destroyed undead can’t be animated again.

You can create one or more undead creatures with a total CR of no more than half your caster level. You can only create one type of undead with each casting of this spell. Creating undead requires special materials worth 1,000 credits × the total CR of the undead created; these materials are consumed as part of casting the spell.

The undead you create remain under your control indefinitely. No matter how many times you use this spell, however, you can control only a number of undead whose total CR is no greater than your caster level. If you exceed this number, all the newly created creatures fall under your control and any excess undead from previous castings become uncontrolled. You choose which creatures are released. Once released, such undead have no particular feelings of loyalty to you, and in time they may grow in power beyond the undead you can create.

The corpses you use must be as intact as the typical undead of the type you choose to create. For example, a skeleton can be created only from a mostly intact corpse (that has bones) or skeleton. A zombie can be created only from a creature with a physical anatomy.
