Effect: Three times per day as a standard action, you can use a quantum weapon to make two ranged attacks, each against a different target. After learning the result of each attack, you must pick one attack to ignore (it doesn’t hit or expend ammunition and has no effects) and apply the effects of the other attack (such as damage and critical hit effects) as normal. This fusion can be applied only to ranged weapons.
