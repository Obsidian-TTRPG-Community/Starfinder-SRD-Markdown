## Aeon Stone, Opalescent White Pyramid

**Source**:: _Starfinder Escape from the Prison Moon pg. 44_
**Level**:: 3
**Price**::  1400
**Bulk**:: —

### Description

While this _aeon stone_ orbits you, you have proficiency with one kind of weapon (laser pistol, plasma doshko, zero pistol, and so on) at all item levels. Each stone of this type is keyed to a particular kind of weapon when it is created. Changing the type of weapon an existing _opalescent white pyramid aeon stone_ is keyed to requires time and 3 ranks in Mysticism, as if you were crafting the _aeon stone_, but this alteration has no cost.
