## Equinoxian Periastra Cr 9

Equinoxians are rare and unusual native outsiders who simultaneously embody the power of both black holes and blazing suns. Alternating waves of photons and gravitons constantly travel along their roughly humanoid‑shaped bodies. An equinoxian’s head and legs might shine with light while its torso and arms remain as black as the void, and a few seconds later, the opposite may be true, as waves of energy ripple through the equinoxian’s body. As equinoxians age and their connection to the Cycle grows, they must learn to master the perfect balance of the contradictory powers within themselves, lest they lose control of those forces.
Equinoxian periastras are masters of the Cycle, perpetually balancing the gravitonic and photonic forces comprising their bodies, and they are legendary for their fighting prowess. They oppose forces of chaos and guard sites holy to solarians, allowing visitors to enter only after they have proven their mastery of the Cycle in combat.
Those equinoxians who cannot maintain balance are driven mad, becoming the tragic and powerful figures known as apastras. Apastras seek to cause imbalance and collapse wherever they can, and solarians justly fear the enraged creatures.
