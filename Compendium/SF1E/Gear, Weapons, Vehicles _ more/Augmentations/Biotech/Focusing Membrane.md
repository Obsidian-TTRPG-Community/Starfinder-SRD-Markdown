# FOCUSING MEMBRANE
The biological tissue a tashtari uses to produce its muzzle beam, a focusing membrane must be installed as part of an optical laser cybernetic augmentation of its item level or higher, adding to that augmentation’s cost but allowing two augmentations in one system. An optical laser modified with a focusing membrane treats a target’s fire resistance as if it were 5 lower (10 lower for mk 2). This benefit does not apply to the laser’s burn critical hit effect.
