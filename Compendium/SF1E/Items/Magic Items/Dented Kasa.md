### Description

A conical helm of battered metal, a _dented kasa_ is a headgear with a history. Helmets of this sort belonged to veteran warriors of ages past, each dent representing a potentially mortal blow the kasa deflected. You wear the kasa by incorporating it into part of your armor’s headwear. The helmet counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.  
  
While wearing the _dented kasa_, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against critical hit effects. In addition, when you take a critical hit, you can spend 2 Resolve Points as a reaction to negate the resulting extra damage and critical hit effect. When you do so, the kasa gains a new dent, scratch, or other mark.
