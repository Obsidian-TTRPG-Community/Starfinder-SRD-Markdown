## Description

You manipulate the energy that swirls around the target’s head, pulling it inward and potentially crushing its skull. You must make a ranged attack against the target’s EAC to ensure this spell hits the necessary weak spots in the target’s head, but you can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit and the target fails a Fortitude saving throw, it takes 18d8 damage. If the target succeeds at its saving throw, it instead takes 4d8 damage. The target might die from damage even if it succeeds at its saving throw; in this case, the spell is not a death effect. This spell has no effect against living creatures that don’t have an anatomical head.
