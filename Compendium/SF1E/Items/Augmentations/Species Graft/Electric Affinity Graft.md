# Electric Affinity Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 143_  
**Level**:: 8
**Price**::  9500 
**System**:: All Hands and Skin  
Having evolved on electrically active Arkanen, not only are dirindis unharmed by minor electrical effects, but they can also channel that energy into magic. Microresistors implanted under your dermal layer channel electrical energy to emitters in your hands (or similar appendages). You gain resistance 5 to electricity. In addition, you can cast jolting surge once per day and energy ray (electricity only) at will as spell-like abilities. The caster level of these effects is equal to your level.
