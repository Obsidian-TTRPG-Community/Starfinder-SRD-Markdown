# Operative Alternate Class Features

## Heavyweight Skirmisher

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 28_  
**Class** Operative

You dance across battlefields with power and precision. Your operative key ability score becomes Strength. Operative abilities and saving throw DCs calculated using your Dexterity ability score modifier are instead calculated using your Strength ability score modifier. You don’t gain proficiency with sniper weapons, but you do gain proficiency with advanced melee weapons.  
You can perform trick attacks with a wider array of weapons, referred to here as “skirmisher weapons.” A skirmisher weapon is any weapon you’re wielding and proficient with that doesn’t target multiple creatures, have the unwieldy property, or require a full action to make a single attack. If you succeed at the trick attack skill check, you can reroll one of the attack’s damage dice and use the higher result. At 7th, 11th, 15th, 17th, and 19th levels, you can reroll one additional damage die (maximum 6 dice) and use the higher result for each. You don’t deal additional trick attack damage until 5th level, but you can apply that additional damage to attacks with skirmisher weapons. At 5th level, your additional trick attack damage is 1d6. This increases to 2d6 at 9th level, 2d8 at 13th level, and 2d10 at 17th level. For any operative abilities that require you use an operative weapon, you can also use those abilities with melee skirmisher weapons.  
You can gain the Heavy Armor Proficiency feat in place of learning an operative exploit. At 3rd level, you reduce the speed adjustment of any armor you wear by 5 feet (minimum no speed adjustment) and reduce the armor check penalty of any armor you wear by 1 (to a minimum of 0). At 9th level, your land speed increases by 5 feet, and you increase the maximum Dexterity bonus allowed by your armor by 1. At 15th level, you reduce the speed adjustment of any armor you wear by 10 feet total and gain DR 5/— against attacks of opportunity.  
At 8th level, if you make a full attack entirely with skirmisher weapons and hit a creature twice, you also apply the effect of your debilitating trick class feature (or any additional option you can use in place of debilitating trick) as though you had hit the creature with your trick attack. At 13th level, when you make a full attack entirely with skirmisher weapons, you take a –3 penalty to each attack roll instead of the normal –4 penalty.  
This modifies the operative’s key ability score, weapon proficiencies, and trick attack, and it replaces evasion, quick movement, triple attack, and quad attack.

## Improviser

**Source**:: Tech Revolution pg. 28
**Class** Operative
  
You’re an expert innovator who can transform mundane objects into lethal weapons and build functional devices out of junk. So long as you have a hand free and are adjacent to items with a total bulk of 1 or higher that you could readily use as improvised weapons, you threaten nearby foes as though you were wielding a melee weapon.  
As a move action, you can swiftly alter and determine how to best weaponize a mundane object with 2 or less bulk that you’re carrying. By spending 1 Resolve Point, you can perform this action as part of the same action you use to draw or pick up the improvised weapon. When you use the object as an improvised weapon, you ignore the –4 penalty to attacks with that weapon because it’s improvised, you don’t treat it as archaic, you give the weapon the thrown (10 feet) weapon special property, and you can choose to give the weapon the operative weapon special property whenever you make attacks with it. The improvised weapon deals 1d4 damage; this damage increases to 1d6 at 4th level, 2d6 at 8th level, 3d6 at 12th level, 5d6 at 15th level, and 7d6 at 20th level. The type of damage dealt by the improvised weapon is based on the components used to create it—typically bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing—and the weapon targets KAC.  
At 3rd level, you can create temporarily functional technological items out of junk. To do so, you must have access to technological junk and gear like computers, scrap metal, or derelict vehicles with total bulk at least five times that of the device you want to create. Building a device takes a number of minutes equal to its item level, and when you finish creating the device, you must spend a number of Resolve Points equal to 1/4 the item’s level (rounded up) to make it functional. The device lasts a number of hours equal to your operative level, and if it consumes charges to function, it has a number of charges equal to its usage value (allowing the item to be used once). For each additional Resolve Point you spend when creating the item, it gains additional charges equal to its usage, to a maximum of the item’s capacity.  
This replaces the operative’s edge class feature.

## Magical Assassin (SU)

**Source**:: Galactic Magic pg. 28
**Class** Operative

You can awaken latent magic in your weaponry. Mysticism is a class skill for you. As a move action, you can magically imbue one small arms or basic melee weapon with the operative weapon special property you’re wielding, treating it as a magic weapon for the purposes of bypassing damage reduction. In addition, when you imbue your weapon, choose one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. When you attack with your imbued weapon as a standard action, before making the attack, attempt a Mysticism check with a DC equal to 20 + your target’s CR. If you succeed, you deal an additional 1d4 damage of the chosen energy type. This increases to 1d6 at 3rd level, to 3d6 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d6 every 2 levels thereafter. Your weapon remains imbued for 1 minute, until you imbue another weapon, or until the end of your turn if you cease wielding the weapon, whichever comes first.
At 4th level, when you imbue your weapon, you can also choose one of the following weapon fusions: anarchic, axiomatic, defiant, dispelling, disrupting, durable, holy, merciful, seeking, or unholy. While imbued, the weapon gains and automatically activates the chosen fusion, even if this fusion would exceed the number of fusions the weapon could normally accommodate, though the fusion must be one that could normally be applied to the weapon. At 10th level, you can also choose from the following fusions: corrosive, flaming, frost, ghost killer, shock, thundering, or wounding. At 17th level, you can apply two of these fusions to your imbued weapon at one time.
This alternate class feature replaces trick attack, debilitating trick, and double debilitation.

## Sniper

**Source**:: Tech Revolution pg. 28
**Class** Operative

You’re a skilled sharpshooter who deals death over vast distances with sniper weapons. As a full action, you can move up to 1/4 your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with a melee weapon with the operative property, a small arm, or a sniper weapon. If the weapon has the sniper property, you can use the property as if you had used a move action to aim. Just before making your attack, attempt a Perception or Stealth check (or a check associated with your specialization) with a DC of 20 + 1-1/2 your target’s CR. If you succeed at the check, the target is flat-footed against the attack and you deal 1d3 additional damage. This damage increases to 1d6 additional damage at 3rd level, plus an additional 1d6 damage for every 2 levels thereafter. You can’t use this ability with a weapon that has the unwieldy special property unless it also has the sniper special property, in which case this ability doesn’t allow you to move before attacking.
This replaces the operative’s trick attack class feature.

## Spell Thieve (SU)

**Source**:: Galactic Magic pg. 28
**Class** Operative

You steal magic from your opponents to empower yourself. The maximum spell level of spells, spell-like abilities, and spell slots you can affect with this class feature equals 1 + one-third your operative level (to a maximum of 6th-level spells at 15th level).
Your trick attack deals 1d3 additional damage at 1st level. This increases to 1d6 at 3rd level, 3d6 at 5th level, and by an additional 1d6 every 2 levels thereafter. Whenever you successfully use your trick attack to reduce a spell’s duration or to steal spell energy from a target, the stolen energy empowers your next successful trick attack made in the next minute, increasing the die size of the trick attack’s additional damage by two steps (to 1d6 at 1st level and to d10s at 3rd level and above).
When you hit a target with your trick attack, you gain momentary awareness of whether the target is affected by at least one spell and whether they can cast spells (including spell-like abilities). When dealing your trick attack damage to a creature, you can drain some of the target’s magic, halving the duration of one spell currently affecting the target. You can choose a specific spell to affect; otherwise, the can determine it randomly from among the beneficial spells affecting the target. You can reduce a given spell’s duration only once, and the target can negate the reduction with a successful Will save.
At 4th level, you can attempt to drain your target’s spellcasting potential when you hit a target with your trick attack instead of reducing the duration of one of the target’s spells. The target loses one spell slot of the highest spell level they can cast or a spell slot equal to one-third your operative level (whichever is lower), as if they had expended the slot. If the target has spell-like abilities, you can instead cause the creature to lose one daily use of their highest-level spell-like ability (maximum spell level equal to one-third your operative level). The target can negate this effect with a successful Will save.
At 8th level, when you reduce a spell’s duration with your trick attack, you also can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to apply that spell’s effect to yourself. This effect lasts for the spell’s remaining duration or for a number of rounds equal to your Dexterity modifier, whichever is shorter. If you steal a second spell in this way, the first stolen spell’s effects end immediately.
At 17th level, when you apply a stolen spell’s effect to yourself, the effect lasts for a number of minutes equal to your Dexterity modifier or for the spell’s remaining duration, whichever is shorter. You can steal up to two spell effects at a time in this way; if you would steal a third effect, choose one of your current stolen spell effects to end immediately.
This alters trick attack and triple attack. It replaces debilitating trick, quad attack, and double debilitation.

## Marked for Death (SU)

**Source**:: Character Operations Manual pg. 80
**Class** Operative

You’ve been trained with a particular set of abilities to excel at taking down enemies. Your specialization doesn’t grant you Skill Focus or free skill ranks with its associated skills. Instead, you can mark for death one opponent within 100 feet that you’re aware of as a move action. As long as that target is in sight, you gain a +1 enhancement bonus to attack rolls and the save DC of your operative class features and weapon critical effects against that foe. Marking a target for death focuses all of your attention on that foe, causing you to take a −2 penalty to AC and Reflex saves against attacks and effects that do not originate from the marked foe. You can end this effect as a swift action or a reaction, and designating another target causes you to immediately lose this bonus against the previous target.

At 7th level, whenever you hit a flat-footed foe that you’ve marked for death with a trick attack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to force the target to attempt a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier). If the target fails this save, any condition you imposed on the target with debilitating trick has a duration of 1 round per operative level you have. If your target succeeds, you still apply all the normal effects of your trick attack. The target can attempt a new save against the condition at the end of each of its turns.

This ability alters specialization and replaces specialization skill mastery.

## Stunt & Strike (EX)

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  
**Class** Operative

You can perform skillful stunts while going on the offensive. As a full action, you can move up to your speed. Whether or not you moved, you can then make an attack with any weapon you're wielding and are proficient with, even a weapon with the unwieldy property or that requires a full action to make a single attack. Just before making your attack, attempt a skill check with one skill that you have Skill Focus with (DC = 20 + your target's CR). If you succeed at the check, the target is flatfooted against attacks you make using this ability. At any point during the full action, you can also trigger one stunt that you know. The stunt must match the skill you are using for the stunt and strike attack. At 7th level, you can perform two stunts you know. If the stunts use different skills, you must attempt both skill checks, and if either fails, your target is not flat-footed.

At 1st level, choose one stunt associated with a skill with which you have Skill Focus. At 3rd level and every 4 levels thereafter, you choose another stunt that uses any skill that you have Skill Focus with. If a stunt allows a saving throw, its DC is equal to 10 + half your operative level + your Dexterity modifier. Each of the skills listed below has several stunts associated with it.

This replaces trick attack and debilitating trick.

## Acrobatic Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Nimble Stunt:** You ignore nonmagical difficult terrain during your stunt and strike. At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point when you use stunt and strike to also ignore magical difficult terrain.
-   **Operative's Kip-Up:** If you use stunt and strike while prone, you can stand up from prone without using an action and are immune to the off-kilter condition until the start of your next turn. If you have Kip-Up, the moxie racial trait, or a similar ability, you are also immune to the prone condition until the start of your next turn.

---

## Athletics Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Knock Down:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, the target must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone.
-   **Mighty Leap:** When you use stunt and strike, you gain a fly speed equal to 30 feet or your base speed (whichever is less) with average maneuverability. If you aren't on solid ground at the end of your turn, you fall.
-   **Pummel Through:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, instead of causing the target to become flatfooted, you can push the target 5 feet away from you, as if you had succeeded at a bull rush combat maneuver attempt.
-   **Wall Dasher:** You can walk on walls and ceilings during your stunt and strike, functioning as spider climb except your climb speed is equal to your base speed and you don't need to have any hands free. If you aren't on solid ground at the end of your turn, you fall.

## Bluff Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Clever Retreat:** You can use stunt and strike to withdraw rather than press the offensive. You can move up to twice your speed, and your actions don't trigger reactions until the start of your next turn. When using stunt and strike in this way, you can't attack as part of the action, nor can you cause foes to become flat-footed.
-   **Feinting Stunt:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, your target is flat-footed against all attacks until the start of your next turn.
-   **Set-Up:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, your target also takes a -2 penalty to saving throws until the end of your next turn.

## Computers Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  
_SFS Note: Computer Dirty trick is not legal._  

-   **Blindsense:** Whenever you attempt a Computers check as part of your stunt and strike and succeed, instead of causing the target to become flat-footed, you gain blindsense (computers) 30 feet until the start of your next turn. This allows you to detect any creature carrying items that can be used with the Computers skill or can be connected to an infosphere (including personal comm units).
-   **Dirty Trick:** Whenever you attempt a Computers check as part of your stunt and strike and succeed, you can cause the target to gain one of the following conditions until the start of your next turn instead of the flat-footed condition: deafened, off-target, shaken, or sickened (your choice).

## Culture Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Analyze:** Whenever you attempt a Culture check as part of your stunt and strike and succeed, you can learn one of the following pieces of information about the target, plus one additional piece of information for every 5 by which your check's result exceeds the DC: archetypes\*, class\*, class features\*, first language, place of origin, spells known\*, or training in a Profession skill. For items marked with an asterisk (\*), if the target has more than one of these features, each one you discover counts as one piece of information.
-   **Distracting Blather:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, your foe is off-target until the start of your next turn. This is a language-dependent effect.
-   **Wordless Pidgin:** You can wordlessly relay information to any allies within 30 feet who can see you. This works like the limited telepathy ability (as the lashunta racial trait), except it is an extraordinary ability. Onlookers can decipher your wordless communication with a successful Sense Motive check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × your operative level).

## Engineering Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Robotic Beatdown:** Any attacks you make against constructs or objects during your stunt and strike bypass an amount of hardness or DR the construct has equal to half your operative class level (minimum 1, to a minimum DR or hardness of 0).
-   **Selective Explosions:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed and your attack is made with a weapon that targets an area (such as a weapon with the automatic, blast, explode, flexible line, or line properties), you can select a number of squares up to your Dexterity modifier and remove them from the affected area.

## Sleight of Hand Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Ammo Drop:** If your stunt and strike skill check and attack roll both succeed, instead of causing a target to gain the flatfooted condition, you can reload one weapon you're carrying without requiring an action.
-   **Swift Toss:** During a stunt and strike, drawing a weapon with the thrown property requires no action, and ranged attacks you make with thrown weapons don't provoke attacks of opportunity.
-   **Swipe:** If your stunt and strike is made with a melee weapon and the skill check and attack roll succeed, you take one easily accessed item from the target's body, instead of causing them to be flat-footed, and are then holding it. This includes anything the target is not wielding which they could draw as a move action or less. You must have a hand free to use this stunt.

## Stealth Stunts

**Source**:: _Character Operations Manual pg. 80_  

-   **Hidden Strike:** If your stunt and strike skill check succeeds, your movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity from your target.
-   **Sniper's Stunt:** If you were hidden at the start of your turn and have cover or concealment at the end of your turn, you can attempt a Stealth check to hide as if you were using the sniping task of the Stealth skill.

## Quick Cover (EX)

**Source**:: Character Operations Manual pg. 82
**Class** Operative

As a move action, you can crouch, minimize your profile, and otherwise maximize the cover you gain in an environment without taking the time to go fully prone or move to hide behind larger objects. By flipping a table to be on its edge, knocking over piles of boxes, spinning to keep your profile behind a light pole, or other actions, you gain cover from objects normally too small to provide cover. Objects that would normally offer no cover instead grant you partial cover, and objects that would normally offer partial cover instead grant you normal cover. This benefit lasts only until you leave your square or the beginning of your next turn, whichever happens first, and to gain the benefit again you must leave your current square.

All other rules for determining if an object grants cover against a specific attack still apply. This ability cannot be used to gain improved cover or total cover.

This replaces quick movement.

## Quick Trick (EX)

**Source**:: Character Operations Manual pg. 82
**Class** Operative

You can make a trick attack as a standard action if you do not move as part of that ability. You cannot make any other attack during a round when you do this, and cannot take any action that affects or modifies your attack or the weapon you are attacking with.

This replaces quick movement.

## Quick Zero-g Adaptation

**Source**:: Character Operations Manual pg. 82
**Class** Operative

You can quickly and easily adapt to the difficulties of operating in zero-g. You reduce the DC for any check required to move in zero-g by 5. In addition, when you use a move action to push off an object in zero-g, you move at your full land speed instead of at half.

This replaces quick movement.

## Operative's Arsenal (EX)

**Source**:: Character Operations Manual pg. 82
**Class** Operative

At 8th level, choose one of the following weapon types: advanced melee weapons, longarms, heavy weapons, or any one special weapon of your choice. You gain proficiency with the chosen weapon type (or weapon, if you chose a special weapon). In addition, you can use trick attack with weapons of the chosen type. You do not add trick attack damage to such attacks, but the target is still flat-footed and you can use debilitating trick. At 13th level, you can choose a second type of weapon from the list.

This replaces triple attack and quad attack.
