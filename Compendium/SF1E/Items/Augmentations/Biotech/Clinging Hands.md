# Clinging hands

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 86_  
**Item Level** 3;
**Price**::  1,350; **System** All hands  
Your hands are covered with tiny fibers like those on a gecko’s toes. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your KAC against disarm combat maneuvers and to attacks to perform disarm and grapple combat maneuvers. You can ignore any increase to the DCs of Athletics checks to climb due to slipperiness, iciness, or heavy gravity. You can’t benefit from clinging hands if you are wearing armor or gloves that have not been either tailored or adjusted for you.
