### Description

This tight choker with a tiny earbud operates as a comm unit’s wireless communication device with planetary range, but you can control audio connections with slight neck movements and communicate via subvocalization. Anyone observing you using a whisper comm must succeed at a DC 20 Perception or Sense Motive check to realize you are using it to communicate.
