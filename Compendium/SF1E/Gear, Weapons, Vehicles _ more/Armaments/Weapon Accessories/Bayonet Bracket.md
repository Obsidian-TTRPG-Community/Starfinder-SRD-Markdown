# BAYONET BRACKET
A bayonet bracket allows you to attach a one-handed melee weapon to the bottom rail of a railed weapon or a small arm. The melee weapon cannot have the reach weapon special property. Attaching a melee weapon to a bayonet bracket or removing it is a full action. If the attached melee weapon deals bludgeoning or slashing damage, you take a –2 penalty to attack rolls with it while it’s attached. The type of bayonet bracket determines which weapons you can use together.
