### Description

A rangefinder pulses a laser at distant targets to determine their distance from you. As a move action, you can activate or deactivate a rangefinder and aim it at a specific target. The rangefinder determines the target’s range from you and its speed, and tells you whether the target is moving away from or toward you.  
  
You can use a rangefinder when it is not attached to or integrated with a weapon, as well. You can combine a rangefinder with a scope or sight (see Scope below or Sight on page 61) by paying the combined price of the accessories. Their benefits stack.
