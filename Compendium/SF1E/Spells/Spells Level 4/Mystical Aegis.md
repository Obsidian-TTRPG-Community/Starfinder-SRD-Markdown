## Description

You grant the target a barrier that deflects magic and absorbs supernatural damage. While it lasts, the barrier grants the target a +2 morale bonus to saving throws against spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. While protected, the target takes half damage from these sources as well as half damage from the attacks of summoned creatures. If the target succeeds at a save against a spell that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, the spell instead has no effect on the target.  
  
This barrier also grants the target 45 temporary Hit Points. These temporary Hit Points deplete when the target takes damage from a spell, spell-like ability, supernatural ability, or a summoned creature. Any other damage is applied to Stamina and Hit Points as normal. When the barrier's temporary Hit Points drop to 0, the spell is discharged.
