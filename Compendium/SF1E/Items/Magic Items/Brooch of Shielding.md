### Description

A piece of metal jewelry originally used to fasten a cloak, a _brooch of shielding_ has a brilliantly colored jewel mounted in its center. The brooch counts as a worn magic item unless you install it in armor, taking up one upgrade slot. While worn, the brooch absorbs incoming force damage, which causes the jewel’s color to fade. Once the brooch absorbs 55 force damage, the colorless jewel crumbles to dust and the brooch becomes nonmagical.
