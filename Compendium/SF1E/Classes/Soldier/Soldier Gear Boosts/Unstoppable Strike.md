# Unstoppable Strike 
(Ex; 7th Level)
source: Starfinder Armory pg. 154
Your attacks with weapons that deal energy damage slice through part of your target’s resistances. If your attack with a weapon does not already overcome the target’s energy resistance, treat the target’s energy resistances as though they were each 5 lower. At 15th level, treat the target’s energy resistances as 10 lower.
