This system of minor gravity generators creates an invisible but supportive gravitational bubble underneath you, supporting your weight from below by anchoring to a stable surface within an inch or so of your feet, without placing downward pressure on that surface. You hover an inch above the ground, and you don’t leave tracks or trigger any mechanical traps that use a floor-based location trigger. The gravitational bubble needs a strong, stable surface to remain stable—you can move briefly across delicate flooring that won’t support your weight and across water or other liquid surfaces, but you must end your move on a surface that can support you normally or this upgrade ceases to function until you are once more on a stable surface for a full round.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.
