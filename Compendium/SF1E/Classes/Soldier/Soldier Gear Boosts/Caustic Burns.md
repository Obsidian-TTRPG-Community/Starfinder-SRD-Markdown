When you score a critical hit with a weapon from the disintegrator category, you increase its corrode critical hit effect damage by 1d6. If it does not have a corrode critical hit effect, the weapon gains a 1d6 corrode critical hit effect. You can add this corrode critical hit effect to your disintegrator weapon even if it has another critical hit effect.
