# ARC CASTER
Flanked by large handles, an arc caster bristles with capacitors and antennae that release more energy than it can realistically control. While many shock weapons have a chance to arc to a second target on a hit, the arc caster is designed to achieve that feat on every shot, and particularly well-aimed strikes can sometimes arc twice. The storm and tempest models feature improvements that build upon the capabilities of static and aurora arc casters. Since there is little way to control which creatures are struck on the subsequent arcs, arc casters are generally used only by solo combatants or those with little regard for their allies’ well-being. More rarely, party members may take particular precautions against electricity damage, such as with a resistant armor spell or an electrostatic field armor upgrade, to protect themselves from an ally wielding an arc caster.

### SHOCK WEAPONS

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
