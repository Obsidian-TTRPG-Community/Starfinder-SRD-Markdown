Effect: A meltdown weapon can trigger brief but painful nuclear fission reactions within its target’s bodies. When critically hit with the weapon, it causes a fraction of the target’s atoms to split apart and fly from their body (Fortitude negates). If the target fails its save, it becomes nauseated for 1d4 rounds and can attempt another saving throw at the end of each of its turns to end the effect. Whenever the creature fails this Fortitude save, its body emits radiation in an instantaneous 15-foot-radius burst. Other creatures in that area must succeed at a Fortitude save or become sickened for 1 round; creatures more than 5 feet from the target gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the saving throw. This effect has the pain and poison descriptors.
