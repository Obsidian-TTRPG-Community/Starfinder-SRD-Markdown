# Elite Valet Drone

Level:: 10

## Description

This Small drone is designed to aid in clothing selection, grooming, and light personal administrative tasks. A valet drone can speak the language it understands, though most valet drones are poor conversationalists and speak only to remind you of social obligations. A valet drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the manipulator arms mod and tool arm mod (containing an integrated hygiene kit and oversized mirror) instead of the stealth drone’s normal initial mods. Its skill unit is Perception. A valet drone has 6 bulk.

An elite valet drone treats Culture as a class skill in which it has a single rank, it can attempt Culture checks to recall knowledge, and it has an Intelligence of 8 rather than 6. Elite valet drones tend to be chatty, and they can spend 10 minutes to adjust your fashion and appearance as necessary for a specific social situation, granting a +2 insight bonus to Diplomacy checks to change a creature’s attitude in that situation.
