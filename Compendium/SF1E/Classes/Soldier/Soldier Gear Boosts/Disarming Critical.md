# Disarming Critical 
(Ex; 7th Level)
source: Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 26
When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has the disarm special property, you can choose to forgo the normal benefits of a critical hit (both the doubled damage and any critical hit effects). If you do, the attack deals normal damage. Roll the attack a second time to perform a disarm combat maneuver against the target.
