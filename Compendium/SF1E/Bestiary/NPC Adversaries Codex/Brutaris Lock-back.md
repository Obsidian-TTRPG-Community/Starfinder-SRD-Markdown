# BRUTARIS LOCK-BACK
Across the universe, sapient species have independently discovered the societal benefits of friendly (and not-so-friendly) competitionâ€”as well as the fame and fortune that can be made by widely broadcasting such competitions to die-hard fans. While some cultures thrive on intellectual games of skill and strategy, others revel in fast-paced displays of martial might, brute strength, or deadly struggle. No matter the culture, those who succeed in these displays of wit and brawn can amass quite a bit of wealth, cultural clout, and even interplanetary notoriety.  
Sports figures are direct and to-the-point combatants with a focus on physicality, dexterity, or brute force, and they can easily serve in any role where violence is a means to an end. Re-skinned sports figures might serve as flashy mercenaries, daring pirates, specially trained guards, or hired muscle.
