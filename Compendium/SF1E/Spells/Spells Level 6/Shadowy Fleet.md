## Description

You create a powerful vision of a fleet of hostile starships overhead that appears to rain fiery laser shots mercilessly at your enemies. The ships appear to be 1,000 feet overhead and target a 60-foot-radius area that you designate on the ground. You can’t cast this spell indoors unless you are within a structure that a fleet of starships could believably fit within.

Each round this spell is in effect, the starships deal 3d6 piercing damage and 3d6 fire damage to all hostile creatures in the area as the ships appear to shoot lasers at your enemies. If a creature interacts with the illusion (such as by taking damage), it can attempt a Will saving throw to take only half of this damage per round for the remainder of the spell. Regardless of whether a creature disbelieves the illusion, each round it takes damage from this spell, it can attempt a Reflex saving throw to instead take half damage; thus, if a creature that succeeded at its Will saving throw also succeeds at its Reflex save in a given round, it takes one-quarter the spell’s damage that round.
