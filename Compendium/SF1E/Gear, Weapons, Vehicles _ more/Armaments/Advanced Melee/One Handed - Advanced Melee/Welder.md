Though generally recognized as tools, welders are so commonly used as improvised weapons that some ysoki manufacturers have begun designing them to serve equally well in both roles. A welder is often little more than a battery casing and an exposed plasma conduit. Utility welders are simple and straightforward, and industrial welders are more powerful and built to be more comfortable for more regular use. Starship welders are versatile and relatively compact for their output, while offensive welders are intended for combat first and maintenance only as an afterthought.

# PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
