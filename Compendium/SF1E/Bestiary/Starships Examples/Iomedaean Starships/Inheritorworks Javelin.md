## Description

Even with 11 fleets at their command, the Knights of Golarion can’t be everywhere at once. Designed to serve as the “tip of the spear” for the Iomedaean navy, the new Javelin-class destroyer is a formidable addition that’s designed to respond independently to significant threats. Though a Javelin’s high-velocity approach is terrifying to its enemies, the Drift is where this ship truly excels. Mobility combined with its stalwart defenses makes the Javelin an ideal front-line attack vessel, able to respond to threats quickly and engage from nearly any corner of the galaxy.  
  
The latest Javelin design upgrades include a punishing array of weapons, which retract inside a spearhead-like ramming prow when inactive. Javelins particularly shine against carrier vessels, storming through any vanguard to batter and disable the bulkier, slower craft before they can launch their fighters. When a battle can’t be won in space, Javelin crews readily ram the opposition, dispatching an elite crusader boarding squad to disable foes in hand-to-hand combat.  
  
Even in its first decade of service, the Javelin has distinguished itself in the field. The highly decorated Ozemheart is among the most famous, having destroyed over 35 Hellknight fighter craft in a skirmish above Aucturn before disabling the feared cruiser Nightmonger in response to what the Ozemheart’s crew considered an overreach of the dubious Hellknight jurisdiction.  
  
The Ozemheart’s radiant exterior belies the spartan accommodations within. As a matter of course, Javelins lack features such as entertainment bays and plush crew quarters, but Ozemheart takes even this austere trend a step further. Some Javelin operators jokingly attribute the vessel’s stiff-backed reputation to the infamously uncomfortable beds onboard. On the Ozemheart, off-duty crew members are never far from their stations. Captain Pela Najani maintains a constant rotation of fresh souls, while a mandatory fitness regimen keeps officers and crew in peak physical condition. Under Najani’s inspired captainship, spirituality isn’t neglected either; her crew observes daily prayers, meditation, and regular fasting days to strengthen its dedication to Iomedae.
