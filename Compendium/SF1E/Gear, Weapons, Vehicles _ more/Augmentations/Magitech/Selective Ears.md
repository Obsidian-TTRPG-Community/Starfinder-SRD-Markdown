# SELECTIVE EARS
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 93_  
**Item Level** 5; **Price** 2,830; **System** Ears  
Your ears are implanted with magical sound-dampening membranes. You can activate _selective ears_ as a move action or as a reaction to protect yourself from dangerous sounds. When you activate your _selective ears_ as a reaction, you can’t take a move action on your next turn. _Selective ears_ have three modes: inactive, muffling, and silence. Your _selective ears_ remain in their current mode until you change them. While your _selective ears_ are in muffling mode, you take a –2 penalty to initiative checks and hearing-based Perception checks, but you can’t be deafened for more than 1 round by sonic effects and you have sonic resistance 1. While your _selective ears_ are in silence mode, you are deafened and thus immune to sound-based sense-dependent effects, and you also have sonic resistance 5.
