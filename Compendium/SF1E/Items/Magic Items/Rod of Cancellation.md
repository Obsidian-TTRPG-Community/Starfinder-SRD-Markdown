### Description

This device pulses with strange powers that drain items of all magical properties. When you touch a hybrid or magic item with a _rod of cancellation_, the item must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma bonus) or lose all magic abilities, becoming a mundane item of its type. If the touched item is being held or worn by a character, the item can use its bearer’s Will save bonus in place of its own, if better. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes nonmagical and cannot be used again. Drained items can be restored only with _wish_ or _miracle_.
