The most sophisticated and powerful version of the common powered battle harness, the warmaster’s harness resembles a towering, armored titan. Its wide shoulder frame normally mounts short-range communication equipment to orchestrate troop movements or an enormous banner to identify military affiliation. It is often used by the generals of entire armies (or by assistants to such generals, in cases where the general cannot be risked directly on the front lines).
