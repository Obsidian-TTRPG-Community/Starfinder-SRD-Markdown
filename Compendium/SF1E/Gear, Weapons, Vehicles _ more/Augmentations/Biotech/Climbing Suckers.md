# CLIMBING SUCKERS
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 211_  
**Item Level** 3; **Price** 1,200; **System** All feet  
The soles of your feet become covered in fleshy slats you can open and close, providing you a climb speed of 20 feet (see page 259). You don’t need to attempt Athletics checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). You don’t benefit from climbing suckers unless you’re barefoot or wearing custom clothing, and you can not be wearing more than light armor. Climbing suckers integrate into your natural feet and do not require you to replace your feet and legs. Climbing suckers can be installed into the feet of prosthetic legs.
