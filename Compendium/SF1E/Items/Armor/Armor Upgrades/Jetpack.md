# Jetpack

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 205_  
**Level**:: 5
**Price**::  3100  
**Slots** 1 **Armor Type** Light, Heavy 
**Bulk**:: 1  
**Capacity**:: 40 **Usage** 2/round  
You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). You can use this for “cruising flight” at a usage of only 1 charge per minute, but you are flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight or vice versa is a standard action. A jetpack can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
