# HOLOGRAPHIC EYES
A tiny rune is carved into your occipital lobe that is magically connected to microscopic holographic projectors implanted in your eyes. As a standard action, you can create an illusion that functions as _holographic image_ with a spell level equal to the model number of your _holographic eyes_ at any location you can see within range. You must concentrate on the illusion as a move action to maintain it, and you must keep your eyes on the illusion to concentrate, treating all other creatures as if they had concealment. Casting a spell (including creating a new illusion with your _holographic eyes_) immediately ends your concentration. The effect’s caster level is equal to your level, and the Will save DC to disbelieve it is equal to 10 + half your level + your Intelligence modifier.
