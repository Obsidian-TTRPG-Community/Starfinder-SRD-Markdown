# IMPROVED SIDESTEP (COMBAT)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 158_  
You keep your mobility when sidestepping foes’ melee attacks.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 17, Mobility or trick attack class feature, Sidestep.

**Benefit**: After sidestepping an opponent’s missed attack using the Sidestep feat, you can still take a guarded step during your next turn, or you can move up to your full speed if you take an action to move during your next turn.

**Normal**: If you use the Sidestep feat, you can’t take a guarded step during your next turn and your movement is reduced by 5 feet during your next turn.
