### Description

Warriors across the Pact Worlds commission these gloves to gain versatility in the type of damage they deal. A set of _energy-relay gloves_ is permanently configured to one damage type selected from among acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.  
  
If you hit with a weapon attack while wearing _energy-relay gloves_ and deal additional damage, you can convert that additional damage to the gloves’ type. The gloves can convert additional damage from a class feature, a feat, and the additional damage dealt on critical hit, but they can’t convert additional damage from equipment, changes to a weapon’s damage dice, or spells. Using the gloves doesn’t change whether the attack targets EAC or KAC.
