# Neutralizer Lobe

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 56_, _Starfinder The Cradle Infestation pg. 51_  
**Level**:: 8
**Price**::  9900 
**System**:: Throat  
A lobe grafted onto your throat processes toxins your body would normally struggle to remove. Whenever you attempt a saving throw against a drug or poison, your neutralizer lobe automatically attempts a Medicine check to treat drugs or poison, using a modifier equal to your level + 2. If this Medicine check is successful, the neutralizer lobe grants you a +4 bonus to your subsequent saving throw.
