desc:: When you make an attack with a weapon that deals acid damage, you can adjust the chemical payload to be stickier but more difficult to aim. This gives you a –1 penalty to the attack roll and the first creature you hit with the attack also takes ongoing acid damage as if affected by the corrode (1d6) critical hit effect for 3 rounds. The corrode damage increases to 2d6 if the weapon’s item level is at least 15, and it increases to 3d6 if the weapon’s item level is at least 19.
