## Morrigna Cr 11

Psychopomps are enigmatic guides, protectors of souls, and slayers of undead. These neutral outsiders safeguard the cycle of life, death, and afterlife. Native to the Boneyard, the terminus of the River of Souls where the goddess Pharasma judges the dead, psychopomps come in a variety of forms, each having their own aims, interests, and methodology for ensuring the journey of souls proceeds to their standards. Stoic, proud, and patient, psychopomps perform their duties with unwavering dedication, confident their collective efforts ensure existence will continue unabated throughout the ages. Having listened to the complaints and regrets of the dead since time began, psychopomps are unswayed by passionate pleas nor angry lamentations, making them seem aloof or uncaring. Nearly all psychopomps wear masks and speak a somber yet melodic language called Requian. Though some posit this behavior is a form of psychological intimidation, others believe the sight of an unmasked psychopomp puts unnecessary strain on a mortal soul.
Erabryths are psychopomps who welcome and escort the souls of androids who have given their bodies up for renewal. Akin to procreation among androids, renewal is generally considered a decision to be celebrated and respected. Once incredibly rare, erabryths have increased in number in recent centuries, alongside the number of cycling android souls they guide. Averaging 6 feet tall and 200 pounds, erabryths are lanky androgynous outsiders
they have metallic, ribboned flesh and a mirrored disk in place of a face, backlit by a nimbus of light that changes color and intensity to display their emotions.
In contrast to their erabryth kin, morrignas are warriors who uphold the sanctity of life and death by tracking down and destroying those who interfere with the natural flow of souls in any way. Cautious, cunning, and patient, morrignas unrelentingly hunt immortals, necromancers, and undead with extreme prejudice.
