Benefit: You can roar as a move action, affecting all creatures within 60 feet. Affected allies gain a +1 morale bonus to Will saves, and affected enemies take a –1 penalty to Will saves. These effects last until the start of your next turn. Once you roar in this way, you can’t do so again for 1d4 rounds. This is a sense-dependent, mind-affecting effect.
