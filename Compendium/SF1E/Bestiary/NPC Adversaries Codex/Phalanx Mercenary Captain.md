Phalanx with decorated backgrounds in the Century War often stayed behind to serve the Hierarchy as elite soldiers policing the frontier. However, those phalanx who chose not to return to the Hierarchy often found themselves at the fore of a new kind of armed force. Phalanx veterans gravitated towards leadership positions, due to their lifetime of combat experience. These needless soldiers lead efficient troops of their kin and other resilient fighters into battle for the highest bidder.
