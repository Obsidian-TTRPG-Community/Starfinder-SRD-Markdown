Benefit: Choose two 0-level mystic spells and one 1st-level mystic spell. You can cast the 0-level spells at will and the 1st-level spell once per day for every 3 character levels you have. For these spells, your caster level is equal to your character level and the key ability score is Wisdom. If you later gain levels in mystic, you lose the benefits of this feat and can replace it with either Spell Focus or Spell Penetration.
Prerequisites: Wis 15, character level 5th, no levels in mystic.
