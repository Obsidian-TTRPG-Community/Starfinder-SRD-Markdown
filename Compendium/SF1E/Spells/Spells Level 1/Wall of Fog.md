## Description

A billowing wall of dense mist forms in a vertical plane, provided the wall is neither underwater nor in a vacuum. In those cases, the spell fails. Creatures and objects on one side of the wall have concealment (20% miss chance) from creatures on the opposite side of the wall. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses this fog in 2 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round, although the wall returns if you're still concentrating on it and the wind ends.
