### DESCRIPTION

_Gravity serum_ is a combination of hashukayak hormones and proteins that have been magically stabilized and adapted for use by a wide variety of life-forms. For 1 hour after you consume a _gravity serum_, you treat your Strength as 4 higher for the purposes of determining how much you can carry. Furthermore, while in an area of high gravity, you can move at three-quarters your speed, jump three-quarters as far as normal, and lift three-quarters as much weight, rather than half your normal values. You also reduce the nonlethal bludgeoning damage dealt by extreme gravity environments by half.
