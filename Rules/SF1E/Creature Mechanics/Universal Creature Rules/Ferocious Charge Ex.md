## Ferocious Charge (Ex)
Source Alien Archive 4 pg. 153, Alien Archive 2 pg. 150
When the creature charges, it can attempt a trip combat maneuver in place of the normal melee attack. In addition, the creature can charge without taking the normal charge penalties to its attack roll or AC. If the creature has another ability that allows it to charge without taking these penalties (such as the charge attack ability from the soldierâ€™s blitz fighting style), it also gains the ability to charge through difficult terrain.

Format: Offensive Abilities ferocious charge.
