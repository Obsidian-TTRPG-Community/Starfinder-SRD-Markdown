## Description

The target of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, _displacement_ doesn’t prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. True seeing reveals the target’s true location and negates the miss chance. If a creature with blindsense can also see the displaced creature, the visual and blindsense information combined are enough for the creature with blindsense to attack the displaced creature without a miss chance, unlike normal for blindsense.
