### Description

A superposition belt contains a series of conductive filaments attached to a small, sturdy container that holds material collected from a quantum slime. When worn, you can activate the belt as a standard action to teleport yourself to a square 30 feet away to which you have line of sight. After using this item, you can’t take any other actions until your next turn, but you gain the benefits of _displacement_ until the end of your next turn.  
  
A superposition belt uses a battery, and each use consumes 2 charges.
