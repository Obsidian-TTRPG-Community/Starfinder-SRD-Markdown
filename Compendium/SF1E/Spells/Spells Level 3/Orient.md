## Description

You focus on your surroundings, from the ground beneath your feet to the skies high above, gaining supernatural insight about your place on the planet. You gain a +10 bonus to Survival checks to determine precisely where you are and how far you've traveled, to live off the land, and to predict weather. If you aren't on a planet when you cast this spell, orient automatically fails.
