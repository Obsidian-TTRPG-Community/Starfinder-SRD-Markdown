| Travel                   | Time           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Travel In-System         | (1d6 Days / 2) | Jumping between two points in the same solar system is moderately faster than moving between them in real space, and is so short as to carry only a 1% chance of [[Random Encounters]] in the Drift.                                                                                                        |
| Travel to Absalom Staion | 1d6 Days / 2   | Jumping to [[Absalom Station]] always takes only 1d6 days, thanks to the Starstone                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Travel to Near Space     | 3d6 Days / 2   | Near Space contains the Pact Worlds system and most of the worlds colonized and contacted so far by their explorers, but there are still thousands of Near Space worlds yet to be investigated. Jumps to Near Space worlds rarely carry more than a 10% chance of a random encounter while in the Drift |
| Travel to the Vast       | 5d6 Days / 2   | Largely unexplored, the millions of Vast worlds are significantly more difficult to get to than Near Space, and the risk of a random encounter in the Drift can be anywhere from 25% to as high as 50%                                                                                                  |
| Travel beyong the Rim    | -              | While other galaxies are known to exist, the distances between them and the galaxy of the Pact Worlds are so incredibly large that there have yet to be any confirmed instances of intergalactic travel using Drift technology. Whether this is due to the extreme travel times involved, limits to the reach of the Drift itself, or dangers encountered in the Drift during such attempts remains unknown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Type                            | Time                     | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Start Thrusters                 | 1 min. per size Category | Though this is rarely an issue, a starship’s thrusters need a short amount of time to warm up before they are ready to be used. Most hangars and space docks require that a starship’s thrusters be deactivated after it lands or docks. However, a starship in orbit always has its thrusters active. A starship also needs to deactivate its thrusters, which takes no time, to use its Drift engine.                     |
| Travel Point-to-Point on Planet | 1d4 h.                   | Large and smaller starships can operate in a planet or planetoid’s [[Starships in Atmosphere]], and can travel between two areas on the same planet within reason (a starship isn’t generally equipped to be submerged underwater, for instance). The travel time depends on the distance between the two points. This amount of time can also be used to represent traveling between two vessels in different orbits around the same planet |
| Go into Orbit or Land           | 1d2 h.                   | It takes only a short amount of time for a Large or smaller starship to lift off from a planet’s or planetoid’s surface and enter orbit, or to make a controlled landing from orbit. Huge and larger starships can be placed in orbit around only a planet or planetoid, and the crew requires a shuttle or other conveyance to reach the surface.                                                                          |
| Reach Sattelite                 | 1d8 h.                   | From planetary orbit, it takes slightly longer for a starship to reach one of that planet’s satellite bodies (or vice versa) than it would take to land. This travel time depends partly on the size of the planet and the satellite’s orbit                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Travel between Systems          | -                        | Traveling between two star systems via conventional thrusters is a daunting affair, taking decades at the very least. Only large colony starships or vessels with crews in suspended animation attempt such a journey.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
