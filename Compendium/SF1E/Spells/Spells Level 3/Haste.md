## Description

The targeted creatures move and act more quickly than normal. This extra speed has several effects.

When making a full attack, a hasted creature can also take a separate move action in order to move. The movement can occur before, after, or between the attacks from the full attack. All movement must occur at the same time.

All of the hasted creature’s modes of movement (including base, burrow, climb, fly, and swim speeds) increase by 30 feet, to a maximum of twice the target’s normal speed using that form of movement. This increase counts as an enhancement bonus, and it affects the creature’s jumping distance as normal for increased speed. Multiple _haste_ effects don’t stack. _Haste_ counters and negates _slow_.
