# WRAITH-STING RIFLE
Wraith-sting rifles fire darts that are loaded with an injectable substance. The low velocity and slim profile of these darts mean the target often remains unaware of the initial attack. Once the effects of the injected substance take hold, however, it is usually easy to identify the delivery method. These insidious weapons are said to be a favorite of reptoid assassins, but as with any information on that race, the veracity of this rumor is suspect. Ironically, this weapon’s models are named after stinging insects: yellow jacket, wasp, and hornet.
