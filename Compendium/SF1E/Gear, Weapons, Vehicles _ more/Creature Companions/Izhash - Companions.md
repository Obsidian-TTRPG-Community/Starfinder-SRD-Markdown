### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Adhesive Spit (Ex, 12th level)** Every 1d4 rounds, an izhash can launch a tether of sticky strands as a ranged attack against EAC with a range of 60 feet. A creature hit by this attack must succeed at a Reflex saving throw (DC = 10 + half the izhash’s level + the izhash’s Strength modifier) or become entangled for 1 round. Creatures entangled by this ability are immobile and tethered to the izhash.  
**Compression (Ex)** Your izhash can move through an area as small as one-quarter of its space without squeezing or one-eighth its space when squeezing.
