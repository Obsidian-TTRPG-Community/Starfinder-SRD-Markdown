## DESCRIPTION

You fire a ray at the target, making a ranged attack against its EAC. On a hit, the target is covered in a shimmering field that prevents planar travel. The target can’t be affected by any effect that causes the target to move extradimensionally or to another plane, such as teleportation, summoning, plane shifting, astral travel, ethereal travel, and so on. An affected starship can’t enter or emerge from Drift travel.
