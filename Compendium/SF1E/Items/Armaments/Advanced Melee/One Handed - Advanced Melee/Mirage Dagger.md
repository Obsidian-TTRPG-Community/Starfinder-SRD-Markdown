The mirage dagger is an elegant one-handed blade that expels an aura of superheated air that causes visible distortions in the air around it. This minor displacement effect makes it easier to catch enemies off guard with it. A wide, circular guard protects the wielder’s hand while the blade is active. Distortion mirage daggers are the standard model; hallucination and illusion mirage daggers feature increased damage capabilities.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
