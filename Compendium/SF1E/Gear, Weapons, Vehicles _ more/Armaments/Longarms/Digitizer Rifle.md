# DIGITIZER RIFLE
These usually gaudy weapons likely manifested within some virtual reality or were created by cultures locked in digital simulations. Digitizer weapons use standard batteries and insistently announce (sometimes in long-forgotten languages) that they require more ammunition whenever the battery is reduced below 20% its total capacity.
