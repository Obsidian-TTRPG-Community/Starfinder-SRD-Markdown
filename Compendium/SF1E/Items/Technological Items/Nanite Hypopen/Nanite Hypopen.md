# Nanite Hypopen

Nanite hypopens are simple-to-use, one-shot, preloaded devices roughly the size of a writing stylus that inject specialized nanites into a creatureâ€™s body to heal many sorts of mental and physical injuries. Seven types of nanite hypopens exist along a color-coded scale, as detailed below. As a standard action, you can use a nanite hypopen on yourself or an adjacent willing or unconscious living creature. Each nanite hypopen has a different effect, determined by its color these are technological effects that function as the specific spells indicated on the chart below (using your ranks in Medicine in place of caster level when needed, such as when using a white nanite hypopen to remove a disease). A nanite hypopen can be used only once, after which it has no value.

| Color  | Level | Effect                   |
|--------|-------|--------------------------|
| Brown  | 2     | Lesser remove condition  |
| Purple | 5     | Remove condition         |
| Black  | 6     | Lesser restoration       |
| White  | 9     | Remove affliction        |
| Gray   | 11    | Remove radioactivity     |
| Green  | 12    | Restoration              |
| Red    | 14    | Greater remove condition |
