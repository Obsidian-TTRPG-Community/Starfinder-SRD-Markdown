When an unauthorized user attempts to hack the trapped computer console, a magical curse script downloads into nearby technological items, which become cursehacked. A creature using a cursehacked item takes a –4 penalty to attack rolls (if it’s a weapon), AC (if it’s a suit of armor), skill checks (if it’s involved in attempting the skill check), and so on. The virus replicates in other technological items if they touch either a cursehacked item or a creature carrying or wearing one. This curse remains until removed by _remove affliction_ or similar magic or by a successful Computers DC 35 check that takes 10 minutes for a single item.
