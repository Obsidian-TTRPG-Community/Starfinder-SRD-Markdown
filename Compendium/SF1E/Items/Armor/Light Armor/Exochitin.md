# Exochitin

Designed by radically violent shirrens, exochitin consists of carbon-fiber fabric overlaid with plates of polymer “chitin” and a faceplate reminiscent of a thresher lord. As a swift action, the wearer can deploy nanites that form claws around their fingertips. While extended, these claws cause the wearer to be treated as armed, cause their unarmed strikes to not be treated as an archaic weapon, and grant their unarmed strikes the wound critical hit effect (decapitator exochitin instead grants the severe wound critical hit effect).  
When deploying the claws, the wearer of vivisector or decapitator exochitin can also grow a set of insectoid wings, granting them a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. A shirren wearing exochitin increases this fly speed to 40 feet.
