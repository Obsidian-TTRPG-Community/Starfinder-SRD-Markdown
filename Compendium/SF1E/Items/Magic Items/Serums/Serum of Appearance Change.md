### Description

Upon drinking this elixir, your coloration and the general form of your features instantly and permanently changes. Within the range that is normal for your race and sex, you can select any skin tone, hair and eye color, and alter the nature of such things as the shape or your nose or chin, the length of your fingers, broadness of your frame, and so on. You are still recognizable as yourself unless you attempt a Disguise check to alter your features enough to conceal your identity (comparing the result of this Disguise check to any effort to determine if you are the same person as your original appearance). In no case can you take on the exact appearance of another creature (even with a Disguise check the level of control is not that fine).
