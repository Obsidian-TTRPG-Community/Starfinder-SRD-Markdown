## Description

With a single mental nudge, you can unlock one or more targetsâ€™ deepest nightmares. A target that succeeds at its Will saving throw against this spell is shaken for 1 round.

**1st**: When you cast _fear_ as a 1st-level spell, it affects one living creature of CR 4 or lower at close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be frightened for 1d4 rounds.

**2nd**: When you cast _fear_ as a 2nd-level spell, it affects one living creature of CR 4 or lower per 3 caster levels at medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level), no two of which can be more than 30 feet apart. Each target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute.

**3rd**: When you cast _fear_ as 3rd-level spell, it affects all living creatures of CR 8 or lower in 30-foot cone-shaped burst. Each target must succeed at a Will save or become panicked for 1 minute. If cornered, a panicked creature begins cowering.

**4th**: When you cast _fear_ as 4th-level spell, it affects all living creatures in 30-foot cone-shaped burst regardless of CR. Each target must succeed at a Will save or become panicked for 1 minute. If cornered, a panicked creature begins cowering.
