Space goblins are inveterate tinkerers, sometimes not always for the best. Retractable tools in the digits of one of your hands (or similar appendage) allow you to temporarily fix objects in a hurry. As a move action, you can remove the penalties associated with the broken condition from a single piece of equipment until the start of your next turn. The item then becomes unusable for 10 minutes (and retains the broken condition after that until it is fixed).
