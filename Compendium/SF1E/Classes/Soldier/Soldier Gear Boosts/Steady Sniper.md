When you use a move action to aim a weapon with the sniper weapon special property, you can make two attacks with that weapon as a standard action before the end of your turn; you take a â€“6 penalty to each of these attacks and must attempt both attacks against the same target. This counts as a full attack for the purpose of any abilities that reduce your penalties to attacks.
