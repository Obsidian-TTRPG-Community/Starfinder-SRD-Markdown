Polarity gauntlets fit snugly over the wearer’s extremities, and when activated, the two gloves generate an arc of electricity between them. Due to the alternating currents, subsequent attacks deal additional damage: each strike that hits a target after the first in rapid succession deals additional damage. The popularity of these weapons has led to the proliferation of different versions, including the cheap but potent spark and static models, the midrange aurora and current models, and the powerful storm and tempest polarity gauntlets. Kasathan warriors who maintain their cultural predilection for melee combat favor polarity gauntlets as an effective weapon that aligns with their martial values.

# Shock Weapons

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
