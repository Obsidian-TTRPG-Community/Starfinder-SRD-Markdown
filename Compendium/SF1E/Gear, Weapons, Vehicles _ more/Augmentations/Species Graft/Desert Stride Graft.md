# DESERT STRIDE GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 143_  
**Item Level** 2; **Price** 480; **System** All Legs  
Having evolved on a desert world, kasathas have little trouble traversing such terrain. Struts installed within your legs or fibers laced within your leg muscles (or similar locomotive appendages) allow you to move through nonmagical difficult terrain in deserts, hills, and mountains at your normal speed.
