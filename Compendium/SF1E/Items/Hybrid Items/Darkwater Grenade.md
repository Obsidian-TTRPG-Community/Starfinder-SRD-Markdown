### Description

A _darkwater grenade_ contains compressed, altered water molecules like a diaspora wyrm produces. The grenade has a 20-foot range increment and a capacity of drawn, and its explode special property produces a 10-foot-radius spread of light-absorbing mist, obscuring most sight and providing total concealment. This grenade works underwater and in a vacuum. A creature that has darkvision treats the field within 5 feet as if it provides only concealment. Magical light from a source of a higher level or CR than the grenade’s negates the effect if the two interact. The mist lingers for 10 minutes, but a light wind or current disperses it in 1 minute, a moderate in 4 rounds, and strong in 1 round.
