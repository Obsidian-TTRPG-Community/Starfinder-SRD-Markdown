# Bestow Curse

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 341_  
**Classes**:: Mystic 3  
**School**:: necromancy (curse)

**Saving-Throw**:: Will negates

## Description

You place a terrible curse on the target, stealing either its overall competency or its ability to think and act on its feet. Choose one of the following.

-   The target takes a –4 penalty to ability checks, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks.
-   Each turn, the target has a 50% chance to act normally; otherwise, it takes no action.

You can also invent your own curse (see Afflictions on page 414 for a few ideas), but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The curse bestowed by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a _break enchantment_, _miracle_, _remove affliction_, or _wish_ spell.

Casting this spell doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. _Bestow curse_ counters _remove affliction_.
