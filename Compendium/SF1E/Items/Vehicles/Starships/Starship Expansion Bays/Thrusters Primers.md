# Thrusters Primers

**PCU** 5; **Cost (in BP)** 1  
By dedicating additional space to the thrusters and related systems, a starship can vastly decrease the amount of time needed for its thrusters to warm up and engage. The thrusters primer reduces the time needed to start the thrusters from 1 minute per size category to 1 round per size category, allowing even immense starships to finish the ignition sequence in less than a minute. During the first engineering phase of starship combat, a thrusters primer grants a short boost to a starship’s propulsion, automatically increasing the starship’s speed by 2 as though the engineer had used the divert action to direct power to the engines.
