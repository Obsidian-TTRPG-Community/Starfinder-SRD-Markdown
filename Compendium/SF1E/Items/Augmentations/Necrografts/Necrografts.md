**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 94_  
Necrografts are [[Augmentations|augmentations]] utilizing [[Undead]] organs and necromantic [[Starfinder-SRD/SF1E/Compendium/Spells/Rituals/Rituals]] rather than technology. They were invented on [[Eox]], and they are most commonly available in [[Orphys]] and at the Necroforge within [[Eox]]’s Lifeline. Most other [[Pact Worlds]] outlaw the creation and installation of necrografts (though not their possession), but they can still be found in some less reputable back-alley augmentation clinics on multiple worlds throughout the system and beyond.  
  
Necrografts follow the existing rules for [[Augmentations|augmentations]] (_Core Rulebook_ 208), but they use different components than [[Biotech]] and [[Cybernetics]]. Any [[Biotech]] or cybernetic augmentation can be created as a necrograft and installed for only 90% of the augmentation’s normal cost, but doing so causes the recipient to gain the necrograft subtype (see below). Necrografts have the same system restrictions that all [[Augmentations|augmentations]] share.  
  
For those low on funds, some bone sages and corporations on [[Eox]] are willing to defer the cost of [[Starship Travel Mechanics]] to [[Eox]] and augmentation for any client who signs a corpse-lease agreement. Necrograft versions of standard prosthetic limbs (_Core Rulebook_ 210) and necrograft ears, eyes, or tongues (which use the same mechanics as prosthetic limbs but serve as sensory organs and occupy the corresponding system) can even be implanted with no up-front cost. However, the corpselease agreement states that if the recipient dies before paying off all the costs associated with the [[Starship Travel Mechanics]] and augmentation, the leasing Eoxian group owns the patient’s body, which it then uses in creating undead servitors or more necrografts. More advanced necrografts aren’t generally available without payment in full (though complimentary [[Starship Travel Mechanics]] is likely to still be offered to customers within the [[Pact Worlds]]). 

## Necrograft Subtype

Adding even a single necrograft to a living body causes the recipient creature to gain the necrograft subtype. Abilities, items, and spells that detect or identify undead reveal necrografts (identifying only the [[Augmentations Manufacturers|augmentations]] as undead, rather than the recipient creature as a whole).  
  
Creatures with this subtype are also damaged by [[spells]] that [[Damage]] undead and can be subjected to other undead-specific effects. If a spell or ability that does something other than deal [[Damage]] would not normally affect such a creature but does affect undead, it can affect a creature with the necrograft subtype, but that creature gains a bonus to its AC and saving throw against the effect equal to 4 – the number of necrografts it has (to a minimum bonus of +0). 

## Necrograft Descriptions

In addition to necrograft versions of typical [[Biotech]] and [[Cybernetics]], there are many unique necrografts that can be created using only necromancy. These necrografts come in five possible models (mk 1 through mk 5) and vary in price by model as detailed on Table 1–22: Necrografts below. If a necrograft’s effect requires a saving throw, the save DC equals 10 + half the necrograft’s item level + the recipient’s key ability score modifier. In addition, this section presents an additional system that some [[Augmentations|augmentations]] must be installed in: the body’s endocrine system. The endocrine system uses all of the same rules for augmentation systems as explained on page 208 of the _Core Rulebook_.

| Model | Level | Price   |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Mk 1  | 1     | 200     |
| Mk 2  | 6     | 4000   |
| Mk 3  | 12    | 30000  |
| Mk 4  | 18    | 350000 |
| Mk 5  | 20    | 775000 |
