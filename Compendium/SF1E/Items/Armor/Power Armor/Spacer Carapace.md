This powered armor resembles a bulky humanoid insect, including helmet-mounted oxygen canisters that appear as stylized mandibles. The armor’s wide boots contain powerful magnets useful for navigating the exterior of starships and space stations for repair work or guard duty. You can move your land speed across metal surfaces in zero gravity without having to attempt checks if you are adjacent to a metal surface, you do not automatically move at the beginning of your turn each round. You also gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your AC against bull rush and trip combat maneuvers when you are standing on a metal surface.
