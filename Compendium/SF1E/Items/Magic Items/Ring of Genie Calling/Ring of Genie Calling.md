In ages past, it was common for genies to punish their own by binding them to an object such as a lamp or ring, allowing that object’s possessor to force the genie to do their bidding. Such a punishment is rarely used anymore, but the tradition has continued in other forms. Sometimes, as part of a contract or to pay off a debt, a genie will agree to a period of servitude, binding themselves to a ring or other item and presenting it to the holder of the contract.

Once per week, you can use the ring to beseech the ring’s bonded genie for help in one of two ways. First, you may ask it a question, as the contact other plane spell, except the genie always gives a truthful answer if it knows the answer, and no answer if it doesn’t. Alternatively, you can request that the genie make an object for you, as the creation spell. After you make your request, the object appears in an adjacent square. Bonded djinn and shaitan are capable of casting creation as a 4th-level spell in this manner, while bonded efreet and marids are capable of casting creation as a 5th-level spell.

Additionally, each ring gives the wearer energy resistance, shown below.
