Most gnomes have a boundless capacity for optimism, and this graft adjusts your neural pathways to facilitate positive thinking. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against fear effects. In addition, once per day when you roll a 1 on a d20, you can reroll the die and use the second result.
