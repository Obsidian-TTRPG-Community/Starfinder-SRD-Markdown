### Description

This pair of neoprene bracelets— commonly sold at high-end sporting goods stores and marketed as a must-have for serious athletes— comes in an array of styles to fit almost any creature. Most serious explorers wouldn’t be caught dead wearing them. Each bracelet is weighted, making it slightly easier to keep your balance while you wear both on opposite arms. They provide a +1 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks made to balance and traverse narrow or uneven surfaces.
