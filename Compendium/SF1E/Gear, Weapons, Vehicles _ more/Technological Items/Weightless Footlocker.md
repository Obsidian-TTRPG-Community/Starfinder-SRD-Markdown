# WEIGHTLESS FOOTLOCKER

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 109_  
**Level** 18; **Price** 340,000  
**Capacity** 100; **Usage** 1/hour  
**Hands** —; **Bulk** 2

### DESCRIPTION

This metal chest is 2 feet long and can normally hold up to 1 item of 2 bulk, 4 items of 1 bulk, or up to 20 items of light bulk. When you close and activate the footlocker, sophisticated gravity-reversal units built into the chest’s frame reduce the bulk of any items in the chest to 0. Even superdense materials have their bulk negated, as long as they fit within the chest. You must deactivate the chest before opening it, which returns its contents to their normal weight.
