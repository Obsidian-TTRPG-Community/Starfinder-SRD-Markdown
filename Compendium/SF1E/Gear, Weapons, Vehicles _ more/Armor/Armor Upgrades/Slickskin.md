This upgrade gives the armor a particularly slippery coating which is generally a combination of low-friction surfaces, long-lasting lubricants, and a redesign of surfaces to remove anything likely to catch on protrusions or be easily grabbed. Your armor grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to AC against grapple combat maneuvers and a +4 bonus to Acrobatics checks when using the escape task.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light armor.
