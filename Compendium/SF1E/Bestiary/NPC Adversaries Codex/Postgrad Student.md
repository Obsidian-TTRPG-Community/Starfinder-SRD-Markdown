# POSTGRAD STUDENT
Though many are students and educators at formal institutions, scholars are as likely to be solitary academics or self-taught. Adventurers might seek a scholar to decipher a mysterious text or perform a complicated spell. A scholar could be a party’s patron, sending them to retrieve artifacts or data from faraway planets. Villainous scholars might seek nefarious lore or publish dangerously fabricated research for profit or prestige.  
These scholars have Intelligence-focused skills, yet you can replace these skills to represent other studies, such as a scholar of the arts having Profession (painter) instead of Engineering.

## DESCRIPTION

Postgrad students have attained one of their field’s highest academic degrees, typically involving years of study and perhaps also a portfolio of published works. Postgrad students often experience pressure to make a name for themselves, which can motivate risky or even unethical decisions, such as dangerous experiments that endanger bystanders or stealing data.
