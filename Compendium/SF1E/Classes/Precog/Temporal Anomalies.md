# Temporal Anomalies

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 12_  
You learn your first temporal anomaly at 2nd level and an additional temporal anomaly every 3 levels thereafter. Temporal anomalies all require you meet a minimum precog level, and they are organized accordingly. Some temporal anomalies require you to satisfy other prerequisites, such as having other temporal anomalies. For effects that require a saving throw, the DC is 10 + half your precog level + your Dexterity modifier.

## 2ND Level

You must be at least 2nd level to select these temporal anomalies.  

### Advanced Preparation (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 12_  
Your knowledge of timelines lets you prepare for almost any situation, giving you exactly what you need precisely when you need it. Once per day as a standard action, you can use a paradox to produce one consumable item (such as a grenade, serum, or spell gem). The item must have a bulk of L or less, and an item level no greater than your level. You immediately lose a number of credits equal to the value of the item, as this ability assumes you prepurchased or traded for this item at the most recent opportunity after glimpsing your future need of it. You can’t use this ability if you don’t have sufficient credits to pay for the item, and you can’t convert other items, except for UPBs, to pay for this cost.

### Ephemeral Confidant (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 12_  
You have an ally who exists outside the normal flow of time, but you can only occasionally communicate with them. When you take this temporal anomaly, you can select the means in which you communicate with your confidant. They could appear to you as a holographic avatar only you can see and hear, or as visions that permeate your dreams. Regardless of what form your confidant takes, they can occasionally provide you with some insight that helps you navigate the present.  
As a full action, you can use a paradox to consult with your confidant; you count as trained with a skill for up to a number of rounds equal to the paradox.  
At 6th level, when you attempt a skill check for a skill in which you are normally untrained, you can substitute the paradox used for this ability in place of the d20 roll for that skill check. At 9th level, you gain a +4 insight bonus on the skill check, increasing to +8 at 12th level and +12 at 15th level.

### Forensic Acumen (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 30_  
You’ve developed a keen sense of awareness about your surroundings. By focusing on trace evidence such as footprints, scuffs on walls, and subtle scents lingering in the air, you can reach out with your temporal senses to reconstruct how and where things were moved in spaces you enter and examine. You gain a +1 insight bonus to Perception checks. When making a Perception check to search, you can spend a Resolve Point to roll twice and take the better result.  
The insight bonus increases by 1 at 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter.

### Future Training (EX)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 12_  
Whether your expertise results from knowledge imparted by a specific source or the cumulative effect of extensive training and preparation for some future event, you’ve come to master multiple means of defending yourself. You gain proficiency with two of the following with which you are not already proficient: heavy armor, advanced melee weapons, heavy weapons, longarms, or sniper weapons.  
You can select this temporal anomaly a second time; you must select different proficiencies.

### Prescient Casting (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
You glance into your immediate future to see how to precisely cast a spell while in danger. As part of casting a spell, you can use a paradox to not lose your spell if you take damage from a successful attack against you, including an attack of opportunity, or an effect against which you failed a saving throw.

### Safeguard (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
By carefully analyzing the battlefield and making minute, dexterous moves, you can protect yourself from harm. As a reaction when you take damage, you can use a paradox to reduce the amount of damage taken by an amount equal to the paradox, up to a maximum reduction of 5. The maximum increases to 10 at 6th level, 15 at 9th level, and 20 at 12th level.

### See Weaknesses (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 30_  
You’ve learned to harness the ability for seeing gaps, allowing you to prepare for a foe’s weakness. As a move action, you can use a paradox to add extra acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic damage to your next attack before the end of your turn. Before choosing, you can attempt an identify creature check of the appropriate type; this doesn’t require an additional action. The extra damage is equal to the paradox result (maximum 4), but if the creature you hit isn’t vulnerable to the damage type you chose, this ability deals no extra damage.  
The maximum amount of extra damage increases to 10 at 5th level and to 20 at 10th level.

### Shunt Condition (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
You can delay the onset of dangerous conditions. As a reaction when you or an ally would gain the shaken, sickened, or staggered condition, you can use a paradox to delay the onset of the condition for a number of rounds equal to half the paradox (minimum 1).

### SOMETHING’S Not Right HERE… (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 30_  
Knowing that others can try to surprise them by lying in wait, trox have developed a way to ensure that part of their subconscious mind remains vigilant to scan their surroundings. You automatically receive a Perception check to notice a trap when you pass within 10 feet of it; the GM rolls this in secret.

### Tactical Timing (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
You analyze the battlefield and pick out the precise moments your enemies will be least prepared to strike. As a move action, you can use a paradox to grant yourself and all allies within 30 feet a +2 insight bonus to AC against attacks of opportunity for 1d4 rounds. At 6th level, you can use this ability as a swift action.

## 5TH Level

You must be at least 5th level to select these temporal anomalies.  

### I Knew YOU’D Say that (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
You’ve seen enough of the future to know exactly the right moment to intercede on behalf of your allies in social situations. When you successfully perform the aid another action to assist an ally with a Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate check, you can use a paradox in place of the ally’s d20 roll for the skill check.

### Impeccable Timing (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 30_  
You can see a split second into the future, giving you an advantage in avoiding the fallout from sudden explosions of energy or matter. If you succeed at a Reflex save against an effect that normally has a partial effect on a successful save, you instead suffer no effect. You gain this benefit only when unencumbered and wearing light armor or no armor, and you lose the benefit when you’re helpless or otherwise unable to move. However, if you gain proficiency in heavy armor from the future training temporal anomaly, you gain this benefit in heavy armor.

### Improved Shunt Condition (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
This functions as the shunt condition temporal anomaly, except you can also delay the following conditions: bleeding, burning, confused, frightened, and nauseated. You must know the shunt condition temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Instance Analysis (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 13_  
By examining an ally and a threat, you can quickly discern the effectiveness of potential attacks by gazing momentarily into the future. As a move action, you can select an ally within 60 feet and a target within 60 feet. You can then choose one of your selected ally’s available abilities, spells, or weapons. You immediately know whether the target has immunity, damage reduction, energy resistance, or spell resistance that would apply to the selected ability, spell, or weapon.  
At 8th level, you can use this ability for 1d4 abilities, spells, or weapons from any number of allies within 60 feet of you. You can’t use this ability again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.

### Multifocal (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
More means of controlling the universe’s temporal paradoxes open themselves to you. When you select this temporal anomaly, you can select a second focal paradox from one of the following: ability score checks, caster level checks, Fortitude saves, initiative checks, Reflex saves, two specific trained skill checks, or Will saves. You can’t select the same focal paradox as provided by your anchor when making this choice, and this doesn’t increase the number of times per day that you can gain a paradox from your focal paradoxes.

### Recycled Preparation (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 30_  
By keeping a close eye on the past as well as the future, you know how to reach backward to recover the benefits of things that have recently been discarded. Once per day, you can use a paradox to reuse a single consumable item (such as a grenade, serum, or spell gem) that you used within the last 24 hours. The item must have light bulk or less and an item level no greater than your level. You must know the advanced preparation temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Spell Rewind (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
With a gesture, you can rewind a spell back into your mind rather than have it perform with lackluster effect. When you cast a spell that affects only one target, and that target successfully saves against that spell, you can use a paradox to regain the spell slot used to cast that spell. The paradox used must be at least double the spell’s level. If you use this ability with a spell that normally has effects on a failed save, the spell instead has no effect.

### Time-hardened (EX)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
You’ve mastered the art of enduring everything the galaxy—and time itself—has to throw at you. When you take this temporal anomaly, you increase your maximum Hit Points and Stamina Points by an amount equal to your precog level. Each time you gain a new precog level, you increase your maximum Hit Points and Stamina Points by 1.

### Wait for it (SU)

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 44_  
When you delay your action and cause your initiative count to change (Core Rulebook 249), you gain a +1 insight bonus to the next attack roll, skill check, caster-level check, or saving throw you attempt before the end of your delayed turn. At 13th level, the insight bonus increases to +2. Once you use this ability, you can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.

## 8TH Level

You must be at least 8th level to select these temporal anomalies.  

### Desperate Measures (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 31_  
Once per day as a full action, you can call upon all your past experiences to push out a blast of energy centered on yourself. You deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage plus 1d4 additional bludgeoning damage per precog level to all creatures within 5 feet of you, including yourself. This damage has the force descriptor. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage; you can’t attempt a save against this effect.

### Forewarned (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
With your levels of foresight, nothing can surprise you. At the start of a surprise round, you can use a paradox to act in that surprise round, replacing your initiative roll result with that paradox.

### Help Another (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 31_  
Using your abilities to see through the threads of time, you intuit the exact way to steer an ally toward a foreseen outcome. When you successfully aid another on a skill check, you can use a paradox in place of the ally’s d20 roll for that check.

### Looped Existence (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
You can trap others in endless cycles. As a standard action, you can use a paradox to focus on a creature within 60 feet, forcing it into a temporal loop. The creature must succeed at a Will saving throw or gain the fatigued condition for a number of rounds equal to half the paradox (minimum 1). At 11th level, you can instead cause the target to gain the confused condition for 1d4 rounds. At 14th level, you can instead cause the target to gain the exhausted condition for 1d4 rounds.

### Momentary Stutter (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
You can rewind just enough of time to reverse your position without affecting other outcomes. At the start of your turn, you can use a paradox to mark your current location and activate this ability. At the end of your turn, you can immediately teleport to your starting location. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Skillful Rewrite (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
When you tempt fate and fail, you can sometimes still recover through clever use of paradoxical power. As a reaction when you fail a skill check, you can use a paradox in place of the d20 rolled for the skill check.

### Tactical Oracle (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
You have achieved total battlefield control with your glimpses into the future. You can use a paradox as a swift action to not provoke attacks of opportunity from movement until the end of your next turn. When you use this ability, you can use an additional paradox to grant this benefit to an ally within 60 feet. You must know the tactical timing temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Time Pocket (SU)

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 44_  
You can fold a small region of space-time in on itself, creating a tiny pocket dimension that hovers near you and functions as a null-space chamber that can store one item of up to 2 bulk. As a standard action, you can expend a paradox and touch an unattended object to transport it into the pocket dimension. As a move action, you can withdraw the stored object from the pocket dimension without spending a paradox. Any object stored in the pocket dimension doesn’t experience the flow of time: matter doesn’t decay, temperatures remain stable, and ongoing spells’ durations and effects are paused.  
If an object occupies your pocket dimension when you die, it reappears harmlessly in your space 1d4 minutes after your death.

### Time Walk (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
You can step outside time to move to a new position and then quickly step back if it would be advantageous to do so. As a full action, you can mark your starting space and then move up to your speed. At the end of the movement, you can decide whether to remain where you are or teleport to your starting space. Neither the initial movement nor the teleportation provokes attacks of opportunity. You can’t use this ability again until you’ve taken a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points.

## 11TH Level

You must be at least 11th level to select these temporal anomalies.  

### Butterfly Effect (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
You can cause even seemingly insignificant actions to ripple throughout a battlefield and cause outsized effects. As a reaction when you or an ally within 60 feet miss an attack that targets AC, you can use a paradox to grant an insight bonus to subsequent attacks against that target’s AC. The bonus starts at +1 and increases by one with each subsequent missed attack against the target’s AC, to a maximum of +5. The bonus ends when the target is hit by an attack that targets AC. A target can be affected by only one instance of this ability at a time.

### Desperate Rewrite (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
As a reaction when you fail a saving throw, you can use a paradox in place of the d20 rolled for the saving throw.

### Greater Shunt Condition (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 14_  
This functions as the shunt condition and improved shunt condition temporal anomalies, except you can add the following conditions to those you can delay: asleep, cowering, dazed, paralyzed, and stunned. You must know the shunt condition and improved shunt condition temporal anomalies to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Improved Impeccable Timing (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 31_  
You’ve learned to also be aware of more subtle forms of attack. When you fail a Reflex save against any effect that has a partial effect on a successful save, you take the partial effect instead of the full effect.  
You must know the impeccable timing temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Masterful Preparation (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 15_  
When you use the advanced preparation temporal anomaly, you can instead produce a non-consumable item, with the same restrictions and requirements as advanced preparation. At 14th level, the item can have up to 2 bulk. You must know the advanced preparation temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Paradoxical Genius (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 15_  
You have mastered temporal inconsistency to the point that each of your paradoxes are so artfully inconsistent that they spiral into a cascade of alternate possibilities and powers. When you would gain a new paradox for using your anchor’s focal paradox, you gain two new paradoxes instead.

### Paradoxical Studies (SU)

_SFS Note: The Paradoxical Studies temporal anomaly prerequisite is incorrectly formatted, leading to confusion; the prerequisite is the Spell Rewind temporal anomaly._  
**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 31_  
Occasionally, you can manifest the echoes of past memories into a boon for a present situation. Recalling now-overcome terrors of the past, you regain power. Once per day, you can use a paradox to regain a spent spell slot; the spell slot must be of a level equal to or lower than one third of the paradox used.  
You must know the spell rewind temporal anomalyto learn this temporal anomaly.

### Preternatural Strikes (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 15_  
Through analyzing the flow of time, you have such perfect control of your body that you sometimes appear to move faster than the eye can see. As part of a full attack action, you can use a paradox to teleport up to 30 feet between your first and second attacks; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

## 14TH Level

You must be at least 14th level to select these temporal anomalies.  

### Final Convergence (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 31_  
Pulling energy from within, you emit a concussive blast, demolishing all—seen and unseen—within its radius. As a full action, you can use a paradox to deal 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 additional bludgeoning damage per precog level to all creatures within 10 feet of you, including yourself. This damage has the force descriptor. You can use one or more additional paradoxes to add their total value to the damage dealt. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage; you can’t attempt a save against this effect.

### Improved Paradoxical Studies (SU)

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 31_  
Once per day, you can use a paradox to regain any spell slot that you have already spent. You must know the paradoxical studies temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.

### Offensive Rewrite (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 15_  
As a reaction when you fail to hit with an attack roll, you can use a paradox in place of the d20 rolled for your attack roll.

### Outcome Adjustment (SU)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 15_  
As a reaction, when a creature within 100 feet would attack you or an ally, or attempt a caster level check or skill check, you can use a paradox before the check is rolled. If the creature fails a Will save, you can replace the attack roll or check’s d20 roll with the paradox.

### Release the Hounds (SU)

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 44_  
Manipulating time can attract dangerous attention from the Dimension of Time, but you’ve developed a risky way to redirect this attention as a weapon. As a standard action, you can spend a paradox to disrupt the time signature of a creature within 30 feet (Will negates). Beyond imparting a sense of physical unease, this disruption has no direct effect on the target. However, the effect acts as a beacon for hounds of Tindalos (Alien Archive 3 52). At the end of your next turn, a hound of Tindalos designates your target as its prey, uses its angled entry ability to appear as close as possible to the target, and spends the next hour chasing and attempting to destroy its prey. You don’t control the hound’s actions, and its attitude toward other creatures is indifferent. If the hound’s prey escapes beyond its reach, the hound departs.  
At 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the hound you lure becomes more powerful, gaining the following cumulative benefits each time: +3 bonus to all attack rolls, +5 bonus to all damage rolls, +3 bonus to AC, +2 bonus to saves, +30 Hit Points, +3 to all skill and Perception modifiers, and a +2 bonus to all spell and ability save DCs.  
When you use this temporal anomaly, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to summon two hounds of Tindalos instead of one, with the second hound appearing 1d4 rounds after the first. When you do so, however, there is a 5% chance you inadvertently attract a thing from beyond time (Alien Archive 3 52) for 1 hour instead of hounds of Tindalos. The thing from beyond time is hostile to both you and your target, and its starting attitude is indifferent to other creatures.

### TIME’S Champion (EX)

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 15_  
You treat your base attack bonus as equal to your precog level. You must know the future training or time-hardened temporal anomaly to learn this temporal anomaly.
