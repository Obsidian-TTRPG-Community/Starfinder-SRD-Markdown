### Description

The lashunta shotalashu cavalry wear this protective gear while riding their bonded saurian mounts. Layers of thin, ablative plates make for light armor that moves with the rider while providing maximum protection. Military merchants have taken to creating knock-off shotalashu armor in more modern styles, as some of the traditional nature themes are no longer fashionable.
