# Sneaky Graft

**Price**::  1,300; **System** All Feet  
Many halflings have developed stealth skills as a tool for survival. Soft pads installed in the soles of your feet (or similar appendages) make you stealthier. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Stealth checks. In addition, you reduce the penalty for using Stealth while moving by 5 and reduce the Stealth check penalty for sniping by 10.
