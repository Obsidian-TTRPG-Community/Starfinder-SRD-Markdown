## Description

The Golden League’s powerful Akaio family emerged from the Gap in control of Pyre Spike Station, in orbit just beyond Aucturn. Even though they lacked any records for how they built or acquired the station, the Akaios quickly turned it into a lucrative trading hub, an unpoliced refuge for ne’er-do-wells, and the unofficial headquarters for the League. The Akaios’ supremacy lasted until 40 ag, when they executed a risky extortion scheme against Absalom Station, hoping that the ongoing war with the Veskarium would shield them from retaliation. It failed catastrophically. Upon unification a year later, the Pact Worlds dispatched a small armada to neutralize the syndicate. When they arrived, though, Pyre Spike Station’s Akaio leaders were all missing or slain, executed by lesser Golden League families as a peace offering to preserve their autonomy. Since then, the League has lacked any central authority, favoring more dispersed operations to avoid competition and limit retribution.  
  
However, Pyre Spike Station remains in Golden League control, with five or more different families vying for control through shadowy maneuvers, assassinations, and regular takeovers of sundry businesses in an ongoing turf war. The station’s other inhabitants tend to lie low to avoid the crossfire and political struggles, as they take advantage of the largely lawless sanctuary. Law enforcement—whether Stewards, Hellknights, or even bounty hunters—faces a chilly reception, often being refused services or even chased off entirely by League operatives. In return for the protection, visitors are expected to contribute illicit goods, favors, or labor to maintain the station.  
  
The station holds dozens of hidden passages, secret caches, and forgotten tunnels. Rumors persist that the old Akaio fortune lies deep within the station’s core. Even more troubling, though, are whispers that part of the Akaio family survived the purge, and the remnants are amassing a small army to retake their home.
