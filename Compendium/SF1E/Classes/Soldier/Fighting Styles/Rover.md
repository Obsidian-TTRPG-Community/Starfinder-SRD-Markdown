No wilderness gets the better of you, and thanks to your special training and hard-learned lessons, your leadership might be crucial to your companions surviving the wilds as well.

## Survivalist (EX) - 1ST Level

You are at ease in the wilderness, able to navigate treacherous terrain, and capable of recognizing flora and fauna. You gain the Nimble Moves feat. If you already have the Nimble Moves feat, you gain an additional combat feat of your choice for which you qualify. Further, you can use Survival in place of Life Science to identify creatures of the plant, animal, and vermin types, and you gain a +1 insight bonus to Survival checks. This bonus increases by 1 at 5th level and every four levels afterward to a maximum of +5 at 17th level.  

## All-terrain Movement (EX) - 5TH Level

You gain a climb speed and a swim speed equal to your land speed. Further, when you gain a fly speed from any source, your fly speed increases by 10 feet. This effect stacks with abilities such as the Sky Jockey feat. As a swift action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to inspire allies within 30 feet who can see you to match your athletic prowess; affected allies gain a +2 insight bonus to Athletics checks for a number of rounds equal to your key ability modifier.  

## Astounding Fortitude (EX) - 9TH Level

You gain Improved Great Fortitude as a bonus feat. As a reaction, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to have an ally you can see within 10 feet reroll a failed Fortitude save. You can’t affect another ally in this way until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.  

## Deft Movement (EX) - 13TH Level

You easily move around both treacherous terrain and dangerous creatures without either slowing you down. You ignore all non-magical difficult terrain. Further, you don’t provoke attacks of opportunity from moving through an enemy’s threatened space, though you still provoke attacks of opportunity as normal when casting a spell or making a ranged attack.  

## Environmental Tolerance (EX) - 17TH Level

You gain cold and fire resistance equal to your level. If you have cold or fire resistance from another source, then this resistance stacks with one other source to a maximum value of 1-1/2 × your soldier level.
