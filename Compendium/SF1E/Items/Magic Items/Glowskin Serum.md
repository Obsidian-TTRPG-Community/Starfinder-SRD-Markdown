### Description

When consumed, this luminescent green syrup causes your skin to glow, with its brightness varying based on the armor you’re wearing. If you’re wearing no armor (or armor that has no armor check penalty), the light illuminates a 20-foot radius with normal light, and your radiance grants you concealment in bright light conditions. For every 1 point of AC penalty your armor imposes, the miss chance this effect provides decreases by 5%, and the light radius decreases by 5 feet (providing neither light nor a miss chance for armor check values of –4 or greater). This light doesn’t provide you enough concealment to hide. This effect lasts for 1 minute.
