# SETTLEMENT QUALITIES
The following are just a few of the possible qualities a settlement might have.

**Academic**: It is often easier to do research in this settlement, which is home to a large school, research facility, or great repository of knowledge.

**Bureaucratic**: The settlement is a nightmarish, confusing, and frustrating maze of red tape and official paperwork.

**Cultured**: The settlement is well known for being a place where artistry thrives, such as a community of actors and musicians.

**Devout**: The settlement is devoted to a deity (which must be of the same alignment as the community) or follows a religious creed.

**Financial Center**: This settlement is home to large banks, trading houses, currency exchanges and other powerful financial and mercantile organizations.

**Insular**: The settlement is isolated, perhaps physically. Its citizens are fiercely loyal to one another, often making it difficult to learn secrets about them.

**Notorious**: The settlement has a reputation (deserved or not) for being a den of iniquity. It is usually easier to procure illegal goods and services.

**Polluted**: The settlement’s magical or high-tech industry has filled the ground and sky with disgusting pollution.

**Technologically Advanced**: The settlement produces and uses a level of technology that isn’t widely seen elsewhere.

**Technologically Average**: The level of technology used by the settlement is similar to that found in the majority of other settlements.

**Technologically Underdeveloped**: The technology used by the settlement is less advanced than that found elsewhere.

# SETTLEMENT GOVERMENTS
The following are just a few of the ways a settlement might be governed.

**Anarchy**: A lack of structured government or laws leads to a settlement where nearly anything goes.

**Autocracy**: A single individual has complete control over the community.

**Council**: A group of councilors, sometimes elected, sometimes self-appointed, leads the settlement.

**Magocracy**: An individual or group with potent magical power holds sway over the citizens.

**Military**: A military force controls the settlement, whether it’s a regular settlement that has come under martial law or a base built to house soldiers.

**Oligarchy**: The settlement is ruled by a small group or particular class of citizen.

**Secret Syndicate**: An unofficial or illegal group rules the settlement, often behind the scenes while a puppet ruler appears to have nominal control.

**Plutocracy**: The wealthiest and most influential individuals rule the settlement, often while the poor are derided.

**Utopia**: The settlement was founded on a particular set of lofty ideals, and all members of the community usually have a voice in its government.
