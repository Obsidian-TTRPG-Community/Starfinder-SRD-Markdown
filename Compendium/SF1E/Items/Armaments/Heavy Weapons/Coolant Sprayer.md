# Coolant Sprayer

Coolant sprayers were designed following the principles of a flamethrower, but with an eye more toward hindrance than sheer damage. Experts can easily identify a coolant sprayer by the bulky insulation surrounding the sprayerâ€™s coolant reservoir. The weapon expels a cone of activated coolant that stiffens and freezes living tissue. While not harmless, the effect is somewhat less deadly than most energy weapons. Hiemal, algid, glacial, and isothermal coolant sprayers all function in similar ways, though their destructive potential varies from one model to another.

### Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
