# PREHENSILE TAIL GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 146_  
**Item Level** 11; **Price** 24,750; **System** Spinal Column  
Maraquoi, huitz’plinas, and others have evolved to be able to use their tails as additional limbs. This augmentation grants you a tail that is as effective as a hand at manipulating objects and lets you wield and hold an additional hand’s worth of weapons and equipment. This doesn’t increase the number of attacks you can make during combat.
