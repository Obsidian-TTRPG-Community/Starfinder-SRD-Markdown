# Zeizerer Diffractor

Crafted by the talented smiths of the drow of Apostae, this armor is designed to be light and supple. Its refractive planes are all at the molecular level, resulting in armor that appears to almost absorb light. House Zeizerer is the main distributor of this armor to the rest of the Pact Worlds, but other drow houses have been known to manufacture their own versions.
