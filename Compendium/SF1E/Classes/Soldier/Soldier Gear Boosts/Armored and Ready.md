You’re able to quickly don any armor that you’re proficient with in one-quarter the normal time—reduced to 1 full action for light armor and 4 rounds for heavy armor—without taking any penalties for donning armor hastily. For armor of at least 8th level but less than 16th level, this reduces the time required to don light armor to a standard action, and armor of 16th level and higher to a swift action.
