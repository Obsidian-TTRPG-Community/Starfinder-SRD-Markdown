# Ghoul Glands

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 95_  

**System**:: Skin  
Ghoul glands are a series of hundreds of tiny undead sweat glands installed just under the surface of your skin, replacing many of your natural sweat glands. The glands produce their own loathsome chemicals, but they also pull energy from your body and mind and use it to create a staggering or paralyzing effect on foes. As a standard action a number of times per day equal to the necrograft’s mark, you can activate the glands and attempt to touch a foe (doing so requires a successful melee attack roll against the target’s KAC). The target must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or be staggered (for mk 1 through mk 3 ghoul glands) or stunned (for mk 4 and mk 5 ghoul glands) for 1d4 rounds.
