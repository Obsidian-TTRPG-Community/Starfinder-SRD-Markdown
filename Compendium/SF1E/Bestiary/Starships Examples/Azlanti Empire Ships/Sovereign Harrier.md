## DESCRIPTION

The Sovereign Harrier is one of the most iconic vessels of the Azlanti Star Empire. Each crew member slots into a capsule cockpit within the ship’s torso, where they work with one another and as part of a larger squadron of harriers. These fighters are the keystone of imperial naval maneuvers, and they and their pilots feature heavily in several mainstream Azlanti entertainment series.
