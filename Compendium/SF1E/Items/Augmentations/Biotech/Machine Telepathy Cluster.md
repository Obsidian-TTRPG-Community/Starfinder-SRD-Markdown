# Machine Telepathy Cluster

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 103_  
**Level**:: 5
**Price**::  2500 
**System**:: Brain  
This clump of artificial synapses allows you to attempt Computers checks to access unsecured systems (or systems to which you already have access) within 10 feet. You can’t use this augmentation to attempt any other Computers checks. You can also communicate with spectra within 50 feet as though you had the spectra’s machine telepathy special ability, and when crafting items that require Computers or Engineering, you treat your number of ranks in those skills as 1 higher.
