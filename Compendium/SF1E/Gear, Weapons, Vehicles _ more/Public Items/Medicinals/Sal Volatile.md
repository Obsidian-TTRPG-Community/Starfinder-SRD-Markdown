This injection restores consciousness quickly once you are injected. If you are unconscious due to Hit Point loss, you immediately gain a number of Hit Points equal to the medicinal’s tier. If you are unconscious due to a failed saving throw, you immediately get a new saving throw against the same DC as the effect that caused the unconsciousness with a bonus equal to 3 + the medicinal’s tier. If you succeed, you regain consciousness.
