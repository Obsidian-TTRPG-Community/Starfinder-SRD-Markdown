## Description

An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are staggered (see page 277). A slowed creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment). Multiple slow effects donâ€™t stack. Slow counters and negates haste.
