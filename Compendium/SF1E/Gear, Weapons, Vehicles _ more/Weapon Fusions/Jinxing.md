Effect: A weapon with the jinxing weapon fusion gains the jinx critical hit effect. A target affected by the jinx critical hit effect must succeed at a Will save (DC as normal for a weapon of the given item level) or roll all attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks twice and use the lower result. This effect lasts until the end of the target’s next turn. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, you can choose to apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the jinx effect when you score a critical hit.
