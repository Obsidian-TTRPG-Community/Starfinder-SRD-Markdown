### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Convergence Protocol (Su)** If a non-construct creature dies within 30 feet of the planashar, the planashar can attempt to trap that creature in a telekinetic stasis field. The creature must succeed at a DC 24 Fortitude save or be telekinetically flattened into a two-dimensional form that the planashar immediately assimilates, leaving no trace of the creature’s body behind in the three-dimensional world.  
**Simulacrum (Su)** As a full action, a planashar can construct a simulacrum from the remains of a technological construct. This simulacrum is a creature of a CR equal to the planashar’s CR minus 3 that uses the combatant array for its statistics, except its Hit Points are equal to 20% of the planashar’s and its attacks are determined by its simulacrum template graft (see below). The simulacrum takes its own actions, at the planashar’s direction, and acts on the planashar’s initiative. The planashar can control only one simulacrum at a time and can’t create a new one while a simulacrum is already active.  
**Sudden Severance** If a planashar’s simulacrum is destroyed, the planashar takes 10d20 damage and is stunned for 1 round.  
**Two Dimensional (Su)** The planashar can occupy squares occupied by other creatures, and its movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. It gains a +4 bonus to AC against ranged attacks.

## DESCRIPTION

Planashars belong to a militaristic and aggressive civilization of two-dimensional constructs known as the Planashar Dominion. They vowed long ago to assimilate the Pact Worlds and the rest of the known three-dimensional galaxy by any means necessary.

Despite their uncertain origins, planashars maintain that, just like anacites, the First 0nes of Aballon created their kind. Planashars believe that the First Ones foresaw the coming of some cataclysmic event that would destroy the three-dimensional galaxy as they knew it; as a result, they created the Planashar Dominion as well as a hidden dimension known as the Infinite Loop—an endless, entirely two-dimensional realm. Planashars claim that they have evidence of the First Ones’ intent to transform all matter into two-dimensional forms and merge existence with the Infinite Loop, which will thereby save all creation from impending doom.

Calling themselves Those Who Converge, planashars have discovered a way to return to the Material Plane. They focus on following through with the First Ones’ alleged plans to “save” the galaxy by uniting two- and three-dimensional realities into one and, in the process, destroy anacites once and for all.
