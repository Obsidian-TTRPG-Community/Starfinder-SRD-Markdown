## Description

You transform a pile of technological junk into three grenades. You must target inert, nonworking electronic equipment of at least 1 bulk. Valid targets include a broken computer system, nonworking or unconnected computer or robot parts, a destroyed robot or another such trashed mechanical system, or any combination of related electronic components from the above, as long as the junk is found in sufficient quantity.  
You’re automatically proficient with these grenades, and these grenades function only for you. Each grenade’s damage and explode radius varies by the spell’s level. If the spell lets you choose between multiple damage types, you can choose for grenades to deal different damage types (for a grenade that deals energy damage, choose acid, cold, electricity, or fire). As a full action, you can change the damage and damage type of a junk grenade you’re holding into a different type allowed by the spell. Creatures affected by a junk grenade can attempt a Reflex saving throw using your spell’s saving throw DC to take half damage.  
When you cast this spell as a 2nd-level or higher spell, rather than creating 3 grenades, you can choose to create 5 grenades using the next lowest spell level (such as 5 grenades that deal 2d6 piercing damage when casting this as a 3rd-level spell).  
**1st:** Each junk grenade deals 1d6 piercing damage and has an explode radius of 10 feet.  
**2nd:** Each junk grenade deals 2d6 piercing damage and has an explode radius of 10 feet.  
**3rd:** Each junk grenade deals either 4d6 piercing damage or 4d4 energy damage and has an explode radius of 10 feet.  
**4th:** Each junk grenade deals either 6d6 piercing damage or 6d4 energy damage and has an explode radius of 15 feet.  
**5th:** Each junk grenade deals either 8d6 piercing damage or 8d4 energy damage and has an explode radius of 10 feet.  
**6th:** Each junk grenade deals either 11d6 piercing damage or 11d4 energy damage and has an explode radius of 15 feet.
