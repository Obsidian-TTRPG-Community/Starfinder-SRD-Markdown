### DESCRIPTION

AbadarCorp’s new portable self-care device, the Relaxu is a padded collar that loosely covers the shoulders and lower neck, designed for busy professionals and distant explorers. It monitors a range of biometric data, which it uses to provide automated massages, aromatherapy, soft-spoken encouragement, or guided meditation. When using a Relaxu while resting 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points, you also regain 1d4 Hit Points. Every 10 minutes you rest while using a Relaxu is treated as 1 hour of rest for the purpose of recovering from the exhausted and fatigued conditions.
