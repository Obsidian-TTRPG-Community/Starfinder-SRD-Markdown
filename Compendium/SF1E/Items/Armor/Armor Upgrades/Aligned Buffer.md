This upgrade bolsters your armor against threats from beyond the Material Plane. Against effects created by outsiders, the armor grants you DR 3/— as well as resistance 3 against acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic damage. If the outsider has any alignment subtypes, this protection might increase. If at least one of the outsider’s alignment subtypes is the opposite of your alignment (such as a demon with the evil subtype attacking a good-aligned wearer), increase the damage reduction and energy resistance values by 2 each. If the outsider has two alignment subtypes that are opposite of both components of your alignment, you also ignore the first 5 points of the outsider’s resistances and damage reduction for 1 round after that outsider deals damage to you.
