## Description

_Bypass password_ allows the caster to access a computer, control panel, or other similar digital device protected by a password. When you complete the casting of this spell, attempt a caster-level check (1d20 + your caster level) with a +10 bonus against the DC of the computer password. If successful, _bypass password_ gives access through three password-protected security measures. _Bypass password_ only works on technological or hybrid devices.
