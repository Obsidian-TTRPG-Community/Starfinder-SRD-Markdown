# DIGITAL HARROW DECK
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 226_  
**Level** 5; **Price** 3,500; **Bulk** L

### DESCRIPTION

A digital harrow deck is a modernization of an archaic means of fortune-telling whose roots trace back to vanished Golarion. Once per day, you can activate the deck as a full action. It projects holograms of 54 cards, which buzz around you. To begin the reading, you ask a question aloud to the harrow deck, causing all of the cards to come together as a deck; then, the deck uses hundreds of advanced pseudomystical calculations to deal a three-by-three array of cards for you, which it then uses to vocally interpret the circumstances surrounding your question. This works as the _augury_ spell, with a spell level equal to the deck’s item level.  
  
Additionally, a mystic who has a _digital harrow deck_ and who also knows _augury_ can ignore the spell’s requirement that a Resolve Point be spent to cast it. A mystic can do this a number of times per day equal to his Wisdom bonus.  
  
A technomancer can designate a _digital harrow deck_ as her spell cache. If she does, the deck’s AI integrates with her own consciousness, providing her with a +1 bonus to her caster level for divination spells and effects. Additionally, she can spend 1 Resolve Point as a swift action when she casts a technomancer spell to draw upon the algorithms that allow the deck to function, adding a +1 insight bonus to the spell’s save DC.
