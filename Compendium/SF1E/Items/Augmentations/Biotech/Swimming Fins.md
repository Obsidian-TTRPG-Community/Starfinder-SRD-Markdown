# Swimming Fins

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 87_  
**Item Level** 2;
**Price**::  850; **System** All feet  
Your feet are altered to include broad fins, providing you with a swim speed of 20 feet. You don’t need to attempt an Athletics check to swim. You don’t benefit from swimming fins unless you’re barefoot or wearing custom clothing, and you can’t be wearing armor heavier than light armor. Swimming fins integrate into your natural feet and don’t interfere with your normal land speed. Swimming fins can be installed into the feet of prosthetic legs.
