## Description

You conjure a sparkling bridge made of quintessence from the Astral Plane. The bridge is 10 feet wide and connects one point you touch to another point within close range. Both sides must be anchored to a solid object like a ledge or wall, and the bridge can slope at no greater than a 45-degree angle. The bridge is watertight and supports creatures and vehicles, though it’s somewhat fragile, with hardness equal to your caster level and Hit Points equal to 3 × your caster level. The spell ends if you move more than 100 feet from the bridge.
