# MIRACLE

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 366_  
**Classes** Mystic —  
**School** evocation  
**Casting Time** 1 standard action  
**Range** see text  
**Area, Effect, or Targets** see text  
**Duration** see text  
**Saving Throw** see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

## DESCRIPTION

When you cast _miracle_, you state what you would like to have happen and request that the power to which you are connected intercede. A request that is out of line with the power’s nature is refused. A miracle can do any of the following things.

-   Duplicate any mystic spell of 6th level or lower.
-   Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.
-   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_.
-   Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

At the GM’s discretion, you may try to use a miracle to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous or the spell may have only a partial effect.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are the same as for a 7th-level spell. For the purpose of other effects that depend on spell level, _miracle_ counts as a 9th-level spell.
