# ANTIRADIATION

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 133_  
**Classes** Witchwarper 3  
**School** abjuration  
**Casting Time** 1 standard action  
**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
**Area** 10-ft.-radius spread; see text  
**Duration** instantaneous  

## DESCRIPTION

You permeate radiation with mitigations from other realities, dissipating radiation effects in the spell’s area; the radiation level you affect depends on your caster level, as shown on the table below. Once radiation has been dissipated, the environment in the area has no harmful effects from radiation, although this spell does not remove ongoing radiation-creating effects.  
An _antiradiation_ spell counters an _irradiate spell_, as long as your caster level is greater than the caster level of the creature or effect that created the _irradiate_ effect.

| CASTER LEVEL   | RADIATION LEVEL |
|----------------|-----------------|
| 6th or lower   | Low             |
| 7th–9th        | Medium          |
| 10th–16th      | High            |
| 17th or higher | Severe          |
