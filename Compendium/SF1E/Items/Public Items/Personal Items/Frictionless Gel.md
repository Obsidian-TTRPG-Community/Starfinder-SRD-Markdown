### Description

Sold in plastic tubes, this clear gel is a suspension of millions of microscopic spherical beads that reduce friction between objects. As a standard action, you can apply a dose of frictionless gel to your body to grant yourself a +4 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to use the escape task. You must have at least one hand free to open the tube and apply the gel. A tube contains 5 uses of frictionless gel, and a single use lasts for 1 minute.
