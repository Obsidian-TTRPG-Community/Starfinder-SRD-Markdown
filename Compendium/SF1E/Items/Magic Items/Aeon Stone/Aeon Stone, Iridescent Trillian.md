### Description

While this _aeon stone_ orbits you, when you are hit by a ranged attack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to attempt a Reflex saving throw with a +6 enhancement bonus. If your saving throw result equals or exceeds the result of the attack roll that hit you, the _aeon stone_ deflects the attack, and it deals you no damage or other effect. This deflection doesn’t work against area attacks.
