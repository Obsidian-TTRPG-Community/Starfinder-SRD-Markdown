## DESCRIPTION

Ringworks Industries designed and built Peacebringer dreadnoughts exclusively for use in the Stewards’ Overwatch fleet. These colossal ships specialize in devastating invading capital fleets and reinforcing planetary defense forces, and they are intended to serve as the backbone of any major fleet dedicated to worldwide protection. Although Peacebringers are not particularly fast or maneuverable, merely bringing one of these behemoths into a system is often enough to quickly quell even the most ardent of insurrections. These heavily armed capital ships form the tip of the spear for the Overwatch fleet, with enough firepower to punch through enemy defense perimeters and take out command and control centers, thereby allowing the rest of the Overwatch fleet to quickly overwhelm a disoriented enemy.  
  
These dreadnoughts serve as the Steward Director-General’s flagship when they are traveling with the Overwatch Fleet, and the ships are often used as a less-than-subtle show of force during intergalactic negotiations. During the early days of the alliance between the Veskarium and the Pact Worlds, Veskarium officials were given an up-close tour of a Peacebringer’s main batteries.  
  
The Peacebringer also played an instrumental role in beating back the Swarm’s attack on the Pact Worlds. When Swarm forces first began to overwhelm both the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium fleets, a Peacebringer was quickly recalled from a Near Space goodwill mission. Upon its arrival back in system, the immense firepower of the dreadnought took a midsize contingent of Swarm completely by surprise, obliterating swaths of invaders with each round of fire from its impressive armaments.
