## Hellknight Armiger Cr 5"

### Ecology

## Description

Hellknight armigers train under more experienced Hellknights until they succeed at the test that grants them the full rank of Hellknight. They have little to no leeway in interpreting their orders and strive to enforce all edicts given by their superiors.
Adaptation: A Hellknight armiger can function as an exceptionally disciplined Steward or bounty hunter. Alternatively, a Hellknight armiger could also be one of the soldiers of Castrovel's lashunta city-states.
Hellknights preserve law and order at any cost. They coordinate their efforts from massive citadel-ships, but most of their forces are deployed in smaller groups to handle minor disruptions. Different orders have different focuses and different methods, but they all share many commonalities. Hellknights might seek to brutally punish criminals and pirates, crush uprisings against stabilizing authorities (no matter how unreasonable or unpopular those authorities might be), or forcibly “civilize” frontiers they perceive as unruly.
