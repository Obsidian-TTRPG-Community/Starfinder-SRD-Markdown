# Shockfist

When you attack with this bioelectric organ implanted in the palm of your hand, your unarmed strike loses the archaic and nonlethal properties. You deal only the amount of damage listed for the augmentation’s model (plus additional damage from Weapon Specialization, if applicable), even if you have other abilities that increase your unarmed strike damage (such as natural weapons or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat). You don’t threaten squares within your natural reach unless you have some other way to do so (such as natural weapons or the Improved Unarmed Strike feat). The hand in which this augmentation is installed must be free to make an attack with it. Once you’ve used the shock fist for a single attack, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points.
