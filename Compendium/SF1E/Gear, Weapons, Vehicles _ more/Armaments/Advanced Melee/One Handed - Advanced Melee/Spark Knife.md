A spark knife is similar in appearance to a typical survival knife, leading to confusion among those unfamiliar with the weapon. In addition to dealing electricity damage, a spark knife can siphon electrical charge from its target’s natural electrical attacks, recharging its own battery. These blades were originally created in the Absalom Station neighborhood of Sparks, and different versions trace their names to their usage there: runner spark knives are relatively inexpensive, followed by recruit spark knives. Crew spark knives and boss spark knives are rarer, tracing back to those in established positions in the neighborhood’s social order.

# SHOCK WEAPONS

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weapons’ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
