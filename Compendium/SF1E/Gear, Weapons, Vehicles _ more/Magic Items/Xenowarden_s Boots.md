### DESCRIPTION

These supple boots are crafted from plant fibers and reinforced with magical energy. While wearing a pair of xenowarden’s boots, each round you can move through up to 10 feet of difficult terrain caused by heavy undergrowth or other natural plant-based obstacles without reducing your speed.
