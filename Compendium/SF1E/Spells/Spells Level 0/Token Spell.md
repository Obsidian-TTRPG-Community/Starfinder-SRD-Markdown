## Description

Token spells are often some of the first minor changes that spellcasters produce when they begin experimenting with magic. Once cast, _token spell_ enables you to perform simple magical effects for 1 hour. The effects are minor and have severe limitations. You can slowly lift one item of light bulk. You can alter items in a 1-foot cube each round, coloring, cleaning, soiling, cooling, warming, or flavoring them. You can create small objects, but they look artificial and are extremely fragile (they canâ€™t be used as tools or weapons). You can illuminate an object to shed dim light in a 30-foot radius.

_Token spell_ lacks the power to duplicate any other spell effects. Any actual change to an object (beyond moving, cleaning, or soiling it) persists for only 1 hour.
