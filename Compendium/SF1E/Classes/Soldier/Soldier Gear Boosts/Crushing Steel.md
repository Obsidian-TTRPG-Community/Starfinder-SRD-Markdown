While you are wearing heavy armor or powered armor, you can deal bludgeoning damage equal to your key ability score modifier once per round when you succeed at a grapple combat maneuver check to renew a grapple. If your grappled foe is at least one size category smaller than you, add half your soldier level to the damage dealt.
