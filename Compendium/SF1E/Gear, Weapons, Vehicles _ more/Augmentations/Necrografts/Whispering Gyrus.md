# WHISPERING GYRUS
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 97_  
**System** Brain  
A whispering gyrus is a wisp of errant thought from an allip grafted directly into your brain or comparable organ. The frenetic whispers of the gyrus permeate your thoughts, giving you a –2 penalty to Wisdom-based skills and ability checks. A number of times per day equal to the necrograft’s mark, you can instead heed the whispers as a reaction when attempting an Intelligence-, Wisdom-, or Charisma-based skill check to negate the penalty from the gyrus and gain a +5 insight bonus to the check. In addition, the gyrus provides an enhancement bonus equal to its mark on saves against fear effects, language-dependent effects, and effects that cause confusion or sleep.
