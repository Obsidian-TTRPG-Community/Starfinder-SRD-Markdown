# Biometric Locks

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 300_  
**Cost (in BP)** 5  
**PCU** —  
The systems of a starship with biometric locks can only be used by certain creatures, designated when the locks are installed; this list can be updated by any creature who can gain access to the ship’s computer systems. A successful Computers check (DC = 20 + 1-1/2 × the tier of the starship) can bypass these locks.****
