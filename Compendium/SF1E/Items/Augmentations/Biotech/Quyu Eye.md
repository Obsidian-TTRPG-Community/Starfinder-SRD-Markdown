# Quyu Eye

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 93_  
**Item Level** 6;
**Price**::  3,850; **System** Eye  
A quyu’s “eyes” maintain their captivating effects after the creature’s death, and can be implanted to replace any of your current eyes. As a quyu’s eyes are not visual organs, you must retain at least one of your original eyes to maintain your normal vision; otherwise you gain the blinded condition for as long as you have this augmentation installed. An implanted quyu eye is visibly unique from any of your other eyes.  
When you attempt a Bluff or Diplomacy check against a target for the first time each day, you receive a +2 circumstance bonus to the attempt. Alternatively, once per day, you can take a standard action to activate the eye’s mesmerizing qualities and attempt to fascinate one target. The target must succeed a Will save (DC = 10 + half your level + your Charisma modifier) to avoid becoming fascinated; regardless of whether the target succeeds, it is immune to the effects of all quyu eyes for 24 hours.
