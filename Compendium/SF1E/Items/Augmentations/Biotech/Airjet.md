**System**:: Lungs  
This organ takes in atmospheric gases, concentrates them, and expels them behind you as a kind of jet, granting a 10-foot enhancement bonus to your land and swim speeds. Once per day as a swift action, you can double your land or swim speed for one round. This augmentation doesn’t function in a vacuum.
