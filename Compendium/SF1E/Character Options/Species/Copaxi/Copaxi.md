# Copaxi

 Copaxis are complex colonies of coral-like polyps that develop into anthropomorphic forms.

**Ability Modifiers** +2 Con, +2 Cha, -2 Wis
**Hit Points** 4

## Size and Type

Copaxis are Medium humanoids with the copaxi subtype. 

## Blindsense

Copaxis have [[Blindsense]] (scent) with a range of 30 feet. 

## Gravity Adjustment

Retaining some of their ancient connection to the universe’s gravitational forces, a copaxi can adjust their personal gravity as a standard action. They can treat high or low gravity as standard gravity or treat standard gravity as high or low gravity. These adjustments affect only the copaxi and anything they carry, but not thrown weapons. A copaxi can’t adjust to or from extreme or zero gravity. This adjustment remains in effect until the copaxi spends another standard action to return to their environment’s natural gravity. Entering an environment with a different gravity also cancels the copaxi’s ongoing gravitational adjustment. 

## Natural Communicator

A copaxi quickly adopts new forms of communication. Each time a copaxi gains a rank in ![[Culture]], they learn two languages rather than one language. 

## Regenerative Evolution

A copaxi gradually reshapes their body and neural networks to overcome new challenges. Each time a copaxi gains a level, they can retrain all the choices of one previous character level, as though they had used a [[Mnemonic Editor]]. They must have qualified for any new selections at the retrained level. 

# About the Copaxi

## Physical Description

Copaxis are complex colonies of coral-like polyps that develop into anthropomorphic forms. They develop segmented exoskeletons of calcium-rich shell that cover most of their bodies. Their heads develop elaborate crests and horns that identify individuals. Each polyp includes a set of five feeding tentacles about 2 inches long suitable for filter feeding or catching extremely small prey, but they pose little threat to larger targets beyond painful scratches. The polyps’ bodies extend beneath the exoskeleton, intertwining with additional polyps to create sheets of muscle fiber and even transform into specialized tissues for processing information, sensing their surroundings, storing nutrients, eliminating toxins, and reproducing. Over the copaxi’s 40-year lifespan, individual polyps die and are replaced by new individuals, which in turn can grow to address the copaxi’s needs.

## Home World

Copaxis are indigenous to Tabrid Minor, a heavily industrialized world in Near Space. The planet has noteworthy gravity fluctuations associated with copi, an unintelligent coral-like organism related to the copaxis.

## Society and Alignment

Copaxi society values respect for leadership and technological innovation while preserving individual expression. Each city is comprised of many individuals all working toward a common goal, behaving like a giant copaxi. Legends of depraved spellcasters inspire many superstitions intended to protect against witchcraft, even though magic use is quite rare.

## Relations

Copaxis are avid explorers who quickly absorb other languages and cultures. They are new to interstellar travel and avidly promote the Pact Worlds in the hope of becoming a protectorate. The Veskarium’s expansionist history perturbs copaxis, who are often cautious around aggressive species.

## Adventurers

Copaxis appreciate being part of a greater whole and thus favor traveling in groups. They are versatile explorers who can slowly adapt to fill whatever role is needed, favoring physical responsibilities. However, recent discoveries about their past have spurred some copaxis to rediscover lost magical talents of their species, including an ancient [[Solarian]] tradition.

## Names

Names among copaxis consist of two parts: the shell name and the flesh name, each between one and three syllables in length. A community grants a flesh name to a young cluster of polyps that have united to begin forming an adult copaxi. Only once the exoskeleton is complete and a nascent crest has started to form does the new adult select a shell name to combine with the flesh name.
