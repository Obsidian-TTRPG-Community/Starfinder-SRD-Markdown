# Ops Infiltrator

With three branches—the Constabulary, Ops, and Overwatch— the Stewards protect people and legal rights within the Pact Worlds. The Constabulary handles planet-side troubles, the Overwatch fleet guards Pact Worlds space, and Ops is usually responsible for gathering intelligence. Although Stewards often function as allies for PCs, they might confront PCs engaged in risky heroics, or a canny villain could frame PCs for high crimes to turn Stewards into fearsome adversaries.

### Special Abilities

**Body Double (Su)** As a reaction when they would be hit by an attack, an ops infiltrator can create a figment to retroactively apply a 20% miss chance against the triggering attack. If they spend 1 Resolve Point when activating this ability, they instead gain a 50% miss chance. This is an illusion ability.  
**Cover Up (Ex)** By speaking with a creature for up to 5 minutes and spending 1 Resolve Point, an ops infiltrator can alter that creature’s memory of an event that’s no longer than the time they spend speaking. Alternatively, an ops infiltrator can use this ability as a standard action against a creature within 30 feet, briefly muddling the target’s memory of recent events leading up to that moment; the target becomes confused for 1d4 rounds (Will negates, DC = 13 + 1/2 the specialist’s CR). Once a creature has been targeted by this ability, they’re immune to that infiltrator’s cover up for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting, and sense-dependent ability.

## Description

Ops infiltrators identify threats to the Pact Worlds through a combination of stealth, espionage, disguise, and charm. These agents typically work solo, yet they periodically hire trusted teams to gather information or covertly destroy a target.
