## DESCRIPTION

When an ally within range is targeted by a non-harmless spell or spell-like ability, you can redirect the spell so it targets you instead. Spell redirection fails if you’re immune to the triggering spell’s effects. It can’t redirect spells that affect an area, though it can change one target of a spell that affects multiple targets. The spell’s caster can attempt a Will save to negate this effect. The maximum spell level spell redirection can affect depends on the spell level of spell redirection.  
**1st:** You can redirect a spell whose level is 2nd or lower.  
**2nd:** You can redirect a spell whose level is 3rd or lower.  
**3rd:** You can redirect a spell whose level is 4th or lower.  
**4th:** You can redirect a spell whose level is 5th or lower.  
**5th:** You can redirect a spell whose level is 6th or lower.
