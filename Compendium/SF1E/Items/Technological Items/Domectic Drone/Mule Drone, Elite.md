## Mule Drone

Level:: 10

## Description

This Medium quadrupedal drone is designed to act as a mount and carry heavy loads, just as mules and other beasts of burden are used throughout the galaxy. Most mule drones resemble metallic quadrupeds with overlarge hooves. A mule drone acts as the combat drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the riding saddle and speed mods instead of the combat droneâ€™s normal initial mods. Any Small or smaller creature can ride your mule drone, and the mule drone can be customized to support a specific Medium creature (normally you, if you are Medium) refitting the riding saddle to accommodate a different Medium creature takes 1 day and 100 UPBs. Its skill unit is Athletics. A mule drone has 18 bulk.

An elite mule drone has the jump jets mod. In addition, as a full action, a drone can reconfigure its riding saddle to serve as a mount for any Medium or smaller creature.
