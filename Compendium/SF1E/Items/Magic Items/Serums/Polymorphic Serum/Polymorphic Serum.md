Those unfamiliar with _polymorphic serum_ often believe the churning, neon-green liquid to be toxic or radioactive at first glance. When created, each _polymorphic serum_ is assigned a specific polymorphed form, as described by a _[[Polymorph]]_ spell of the serum’s level. All decisions regarding this [[Polymorph]] form, such as whether it is a generic or a specific form, are determined when the serum is created. Any creature imbibing a _polymorphic serum_ changes into the serum’s associated form for 2 hours × the serum’s mark (2 hours for mk 1, 4 hours for mk 2, and so on). If you are unwillingly subjected to a _polymorphic serum_ (such as through a weapon with the injection special property), you can attempt a Fortitude save to negate this effect (DC = 10 + 1-1/2 × the item’s level). If you fail, you can still dismiss the effect as normal for the _[[Polymorph]]_ spell.
