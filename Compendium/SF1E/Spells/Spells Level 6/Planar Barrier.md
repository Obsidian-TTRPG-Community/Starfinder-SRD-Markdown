## DESCRIPTION

_Planar barrier_ seals an area against all planar travel into or within it. This includes all teleportation spells, summoning spells, plane shifting, astral travel, and ethereal travel. Such effects simply fail automatically. Starships cannot enter or emerge from Drift travel in an area affected by this spell.

_Dispel magic_ does not dispel your _planar barrier_ effect unless the caster level of the creature attempting to dispel it is at least as high as your own. You canâ€™t have multiple overlapping _planar barrier_ effects. If _planar barrier_ effects woulds overlap, the more recent effect stops at the boundary of the older effect.

A _planar barrier_ can be made permanent with a special ritual, which takes 1 hour and requires materials worth 15,000 credits per 60-foot cube.
