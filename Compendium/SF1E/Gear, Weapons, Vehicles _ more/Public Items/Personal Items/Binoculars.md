### DESCRIPTION

Often used by Starfinders and other explorers or scouts, this advanced optical device allows you to view distant objects. While using binoculars, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to vision-based Perception checks against objects 30 feet or farther from you. In order to gain this benefit, you must continually adjust the binocularsâ€™ magnification settings, which requires using two hands and a move action each round.
