# Blip-drive

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 81_
**Price** 175,000  
**CHARGES** 5; **USAGE** 1  
  
This planar engine enables a vehicle to slip into the Ethereal Plane for moments at a time, making it appear to ‘blip’ out of existence. It must remain installed in a vehicle for 24 hours before it functions; when the modification is removed from the vehicle, the residual magic suppresses the effects of any other modification installed in that slot for 24 hours. The vehicle’s pilot can activate a blip-drive as a swift action. Until the end of that turn, the vehicle, its passengers, and its contents pass through obstacles, including other creatures and vehicles, as if it were incorporeal. Additionally, the vehicle can’t deal or be dealt collision damage except from sources that impede incorporeal movement, and the vehicle automatically disengages from all vehicles it’s engaged with.
