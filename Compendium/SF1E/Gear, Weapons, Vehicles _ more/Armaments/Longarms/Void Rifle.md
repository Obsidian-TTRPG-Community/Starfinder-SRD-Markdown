# VOID RIFLE

A firearm designed with crystals from the Plane of Shadow, a void rifle is unique in that power flowing through those crystals allows the rifle to fire inky bolts of life-sapping cold. The rifleâ€™s frigid energy can harm only the living, so it does nothing to constructs and undead. Regardless, the rifle remains a favorite of followers of Urgathoa. Grave- and crypt-class void rifles are an option for standard issue among rank-and-file marines of the Eoxian navy, while tomb-, ossuary-, and barrow-class void rifles are reserved for elite forces.

### CRYO WEAPONS

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
