## Description

Planashars belong to a militaristic and aggressive civilization of two-dimensional constructs known as the Planashar Dominion. They vowed long ago to assimilate the Pact Worlds and the rest of the known three-dimensional galaxy by any means necessary.
Despite their uncertain origins, planashars maintain that, just like anacites, the First 0nes of Aballon created their kind. Planashars believe that the First Ones foresaw the coming of some cataclysmic event that would destroy the three-dimensional galaxy as they knew it
as a result, they created the Planashar Dominion as well as a hidden dimension known as the Infinite Loop—an endless, entirely two-dimensional realm. Planashars claim that they have evidence of the First Ones’ intent to transform all matter into two-dimensional forms and merge existence with the Infinite Loop, which will thereby save all creation from impending doom.
Calling themselves Those Who Converge, planashars have discovered a way to return to the Material Plane. They focus on following through with the First Ones’ alleged plans to “save” the galaxy by uniting two- and three-dimensional realities into one and, in the process, destroy anacites once and for all.
