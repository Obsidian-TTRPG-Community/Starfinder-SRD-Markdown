# PLASMA BOLTER

One of the most common ranged weapons used by the vesk military during the war between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, the plasma bolter is a particularly hefty longarm with a bulky profile that speaks to its vesk origins. Unlike most common ranged plasma weapons, which lay out long lines of plasma or boost their output, plasma bolters focus on delivering a single heavy bolt of plasma. These weapons saw extensive use in fighting back the Swarm, and now many can be easily obtained on the open market as Pact Worlds manufacturers have begun offering their own tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models of the classic weapon.

### PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
