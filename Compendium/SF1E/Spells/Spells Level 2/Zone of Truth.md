# Zone of Truth

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 385_  
**Classes**:: Mystic 2  
**School**:: enchantment (compulsion, mind-affecting)  
**Casting-Time**:: 1 standard action  
**Range**:: close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Area** 20-ft.-radius emanation  
**Duration**:: 1 minute/level  
**Saving-Throw**:: Will negates
**Spell Resistance**:: yes

## Description

Creatures within the emanation area canâ€™t speak any deliberate and intentional lies. Each potentially affected creature can attempt a Will saving throw to avoid the effect when the spell is cast or when that creature first enters the emanation area. Affected creatures are aware of this enchantment, and they can therefore avoid answering questions to which they would normally respond with a lie, or they can be evasive as long as they remain within the boundaries of the truth. Creatures who leave the area are free to speak as they choose.
