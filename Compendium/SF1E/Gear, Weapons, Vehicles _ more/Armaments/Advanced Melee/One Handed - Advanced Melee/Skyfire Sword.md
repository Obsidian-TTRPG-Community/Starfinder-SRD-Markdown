Originally, these swords were known by their manufacturing ID, BSBâ€“1750. Their popularity with the Skyfire Legion led to their colloquial name, Skyfire swords. Vents for burning gas jets line one edge of the hollow blade. When powered, magnetic fields contain and ignite the gases into a glowing corona of flames.

# FLAME WEAPONS

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
