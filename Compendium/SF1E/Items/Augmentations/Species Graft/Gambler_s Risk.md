Worlanisi have the rare ability to gift their luck to others. This augmentation uses specially modified horn-cones, connected to your brain, that channel your mental energy into luck. Once per day as a reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 15 feet rolls an attack roll, saving throw or skill check, you can cause that creature to roll twice and take the better result.  
In addition, any psychic sensitivity you have increases. If you have either the telepathy or limited telepathy species trait, its range increases by 30 feet, but you also gain the psychic reverb species trait, taking a –1 penalty to saving throws against mind-affecting effects and taking +1 damage per damage die from mind-affecting spells, weapons, and other effects.
