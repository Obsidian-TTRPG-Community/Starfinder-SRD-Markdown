NoteType: Weapon
Type: Weapon Fusions
ItemLevel: 1
Effect: The mining weapon fusion allows a weapon to become a tool for digging through rock and dirt, carving through such materials easily. A mining weapon ignores an amount of hardness equal to the weapon’s level for all walls made of unworked stone or softer materials. This has no effect on materials harder than unworked stone, such as steel.  
This weapon fusion can be installed only in two-handed melee weapons.
