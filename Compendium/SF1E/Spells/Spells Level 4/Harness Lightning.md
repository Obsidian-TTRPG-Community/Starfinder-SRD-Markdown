## Description

Born of necessity to contend with violent storms on the world of Shimrinsara in the Vast, _harness lightning_ enables you to collect energy from major electrical discharges that occur within the area of the spell. The spell's area grants cover against ranged attacks and area effects that would deal only electricity damage. The bonus to saving throws due to this cover applies to any save against a critical hit effect from a weapon that deals only electricity damage. The first time the spell's area grants cover against an attack or effect this way, collected electrical attacks bend toward you and form a surging sphere of pure energy that lasts until the end of the spell. You can take a standard action to discharge this sphere at a target within 100 feet, dealing 8d8 electricity damage.
