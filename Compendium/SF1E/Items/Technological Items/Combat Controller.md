### Description

This highly adaptive two-handed device mimics the form and function of the latest state-of-the-art gaming console controllers. While you’re operating the combat controller, you can use any longarms and heavy weapons that have the integrated special property and are installed into your armor as though those weapons had the professional (vidgamer) weapon special property.
