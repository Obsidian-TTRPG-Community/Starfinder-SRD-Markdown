## Rock Cr 12

Fierce, armored saurians, rageshkors are among Vesk Prime’s most famous fauna. These beasts evolved alongside the planet’s other aggressive wildlife, leading to deadly evolutions unknown to other thyreophorans, most notably movable armor plates, and tail spikes rageshkors can hurl at distant threats.
Vesk have long seen rageshkors as worthy foes. Records from before the Gap show that hunting rageshkors is an age‑old tradition, with accomplished hunters regularly wearing the hard-won hide, plates, and spikes. These cultural values have survived into modern times, and vesk and non-vesk alike regularly travel to Vesk Prime specifically for the chance to hunt a rageshkor. The most dedicated hunters equip themselves with archaic weaponry in the spirit of tradition, but even modern armaments are no guarantee of an easy fight.
The smaller green rageshkors are the most prolific species, still prevalent in Vesk Prime’s forests and plains. Adolescents typically break from their birth herd, roaming either alone or in small cohorts. These roving rageshkors are especially aggressive, and they often pick fights with passersby, land transports, and even small buildings.
The might and ferocity of green rageshkors pale in comparison to those of their larger kin, rock rageshkors. These rare animals are typically solitary, and during less prosperous times, rock rageshkors hunker down into a form of hibernation. Combined with their camouflaged bodies and the accumulation of windblown debris, these animals often fade into the landscape, snapping to vicious alertness only to ambush prey that mistakes it for a boulder.
