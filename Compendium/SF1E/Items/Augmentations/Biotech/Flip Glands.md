These expanded cochlear implants orient your equilibrium to zero-gravity conditions; their name is derived from the enhancements’ popularity among extreme-sport athletes. You automatically succeed at any Acrobatics or Athletics checks to avoid the off-kilter condition, and you gain a +1 insight bonus to saving throws against the off-kilter condition.
