## DESCRIPTION

A barrier of light, colored as you choose, springs into existence. You can form the wall into a vertical or horizontal plane, but each 10-foot square must join another. The light level within 5 feet of the wall increases to normal light. Within an additional 5 feet, the light increases one step, up to normal light. When you concentrate on the spell, you can change the light's color. You can have only one glowing wall spell active at a time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled. A _glowing wall_ somehow made permanent doesn't count against this limit.
