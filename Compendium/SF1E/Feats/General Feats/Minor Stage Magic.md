Entertainers and icons from entertainment houses such as the Hamisfore Theatorium on Absalom Station to Eoxâ€™s Halls of the Living understand the importance of showmanship. From a famous mentor or through your own inventiveness, you have developed a minor magical trick to entertain or distract.

**Prerequisites**: Cha 11.

**Benefit**: Select one of the following 0-level spells: _dancing lights_, _ghost sound_, or _token spell_. You can cast this spell three times per day as a spell-like ability, using your character level as your caster level. The key ability score for this spell is Charisma.

**Special**: You can select this feat more than once. Each time you do, you must choose a different spell from the list.
