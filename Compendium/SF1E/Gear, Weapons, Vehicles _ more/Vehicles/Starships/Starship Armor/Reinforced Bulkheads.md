# REINFORCED BULKHEADS
By dramatically strengthening a starship’s bulkheads and other interior walls, its designer can reduce the odds of catastrophic system damage when the starship sustains damage. Whenever the starship would sustain critical damage, there is a percent chance based on the reinforced bulkhead’s fortification rating that the critical damage effect is negated (though the attack still deals damage to the starship). The cost of reinforced bulkheads is based on the starship’s size category (for the purpose of this calculation, Tiny = 1, Small = 2, Medium = 3, Large = 4, etc.).Click here for the full rules on Reinforced Bulkheads.

| Bulkhead Type | Fortification | Cost (in BP) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mk 1 bulkheads | 10% | 2 x size category |
| Mk 2 bulkheads | 20% | 3 x size category |
| Mk 3 bulkheads | 30% | 5 x size category |
| Mk 4 bulkheads | 40% | 7 x size category |
| Mk 5 bulkheads | 50% | 10 x size category |
