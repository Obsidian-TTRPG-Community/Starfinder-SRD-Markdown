Benefit: As a standard action, you can make a ranged attack with a grenade, targeting an intersection that’s adjacent to a wall or large object. If you hit, you can pick a direction for the grenade to travel and then roll 1d4 to determine how far from the targeted intersection the grenade lands. The direction must be away from the wall or object, and not parallel to or through it. If you miss, use the normal rules for missing with a thrown weapon.
Prerequisites: Proficiency with grenades, base attack bonus +7.
