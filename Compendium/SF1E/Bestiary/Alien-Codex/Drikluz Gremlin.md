### Special Abilities

**Biting Bugs (Ex)** A creature struck by a drikluz’s bite attack must attempt a DC 11 Fortitude save or become fatigued for 1 round. This has no effect on a creature that is already fatigued or exhausted.  
**Insect Pacifism (Su)** A drikluz emit a psychic call that draws in insects and makes them well-disposed to the drikluz. Vermin and insectile creatures of other types, such as Swarm creatures and shirrens, have a –2 penalty on attack rolls against a drikluz. The GM determines whether a creature is sufficiently insect-like to be affected by this ability.  
**Vermin Empathy (Ex)** A drikluz can communicate basic concepts with mindless vermin and can use language‑dependent abilities on them (such as Diplomacy checks to change their attitude or Intimidate checks to bully). The drikluz can affect mindless vermin with their spell‑like abilities as though spells didn’t have the mind‑affecting descriptor.  
**Verminlike (Ex)** For effects targeting creatures by type, a drikluz counts as both fey and vermin (whichever type allows an ability to affect them for abilities that affect only one type, and whichever is worse for abilities that affect both types). The drikluz also gains a +2 racial bonus to saving throws against mind-affecting effects.

## Description

Not all gremlins are intimately tied to technology; some represent older troubles that have plagued civilization for eons. One unpleasant example is the drikluz, or vermin gremlin. No more than 2-1/2 feet tall (and nearly as wide), drikluzes boast round, furry bodies teeming with lice, biting flies, and other loathsome insects. A drikluz has a helmetlike carapace over its forehead and crown, which protects its insectile face and two antenna. The drikluzes' antennae focus the gremlins’ latent psychic powers into a constant, crooning telepathic drone that soothes nearby insects into a complacent state and attracts them to their round, hairy bodies. They then bully and cajole their mindless minions into causing as much trouble as possible, including sabotaging insect traps and spoiling or hiding pesticides. Drikluzes have been noted to exhibit some limited ability to twist the minds of larger creatures as well, but they rarely do so for any purpose other than compelling such creatures to leave them alone.  
  
While a creature that lures vermin away may seem a fine service in theory, the presence of drikluzes in a community is far from beneficial, as these gremlins are mean-spirited and rarely content to simply lead vermin away. They love seeing insects spoil crops, terrorize pets, and infest bedding.
