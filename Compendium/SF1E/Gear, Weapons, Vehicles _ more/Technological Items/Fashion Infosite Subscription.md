### DESCRIPTION

Many infosphere fashion sites thrive in the Pact Worlds and are constantly updated by designers with the latest curated collections, and offer subscriptions to ensure their followers are always up-to-date. Each subscription is associated with a specific organization or subculture, such as the Stewards, Pact Worlds dance clubs, or Veskarium corporate culture. The subscription takes form of physical chip you can add to a tier-0 or higher computer (such as a comm unit). As long as you check it briefly each day, you gain a +4 bonus to Culture checks made to recall knowledge related to the associated group’s apparel and fashion.
