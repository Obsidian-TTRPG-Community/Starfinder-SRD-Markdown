## Description

This spell causes all creatures in the area to perceive all other creatures as copies of someone they have a strong impression of, whether a friend, enemy, or even themselves. At the start of each of each affected creature’s turn, that creature chooses to treat all other creatures it can perceive as allies or enemies. The creature must attempt attacks of opportunity whenever any enemy provokes them and can’t target allies (or squares containing allies) with harmful effects. Any affected creature that’s attacked immediately treats all other creatures as enemies. Any affected creature targeted with a beneficial effect immediately treats all other creatures as friends. An affected creature can spend a move action to attempt a Will Save to end the effect.
