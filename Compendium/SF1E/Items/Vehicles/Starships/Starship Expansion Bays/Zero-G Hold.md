## Zero-g Hold

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 29_  
**PCU** 2; **Cost (in BP)** 2  
This cargo hold uses graviton dampers and opposing gravity generators to maintain zero gravity within the hold, whether in space or on a planet. A zero-g hold can be installed in the same expansion bay as a sealed environment chamber (Core Rulebook 299).
