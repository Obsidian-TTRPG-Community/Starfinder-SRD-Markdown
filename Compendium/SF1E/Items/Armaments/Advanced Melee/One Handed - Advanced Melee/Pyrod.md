Constructed from an insulated tube containing an integrated petrol tank with a nozzle on one end, pyrods expel a gout of flame when swung with force. The weapons are used in lashunta dance and performance combat as often as in earnest melee, and many bear elegant laser engraving, sculpted grips, or other aesthetically pleasing elements. Luminous pyrods are produced with a greater eye toward aesthetics, while torch pyrods and beacon pyrods are designed to maximize their firepower.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
