# IDARAN MECHS
The Idari, the massive generational ship that a significant portion of the kasathan population consider home, also has some of the most distinctive mech technology in the Pact Worlds. Designed by and for multi-dexterous kasatha, these mechs are easily distinguished by their multiple sets of arms. While some non-kasasthas learn to operate these mechs using cortex interfaces to control and coordinate the additional limbs, their true capabilities shine best under the control of kasatha pilots, for whom controlling an additional set of arms comes as naturally as breathing.  
The most common mechs present on the Idari are offensive skirmishing units designed for versatile patrol, protection of key locations, and advanced security. Officially designated as IAUs, or Idaran Assault Units, the mechs are colloquially referred to as “tangler.”  
Less recognizable—but certainly more feared by those familiar with them—than IAUs, IBUs, or Idaran Breaching Units, are designed to tear holes through the hulls of enemy spacecraft. IBUs have multiple saws, claws, and other tools integrated into their secondary limbs. Kasathan engineers refer to these mechs by a nickname that reflects their intended use: “breachers.”
