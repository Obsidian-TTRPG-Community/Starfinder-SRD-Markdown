## Description

The Sovereign Sumpter is a troop transport that carries Azlanti ground forces to combat zones while the troops are in stasis, eliminating the need for quarters, entertainment, and rations. Escort ships, such as a Sovereign Monitor, usually accompany a Sumpter, which is swift enough to convey its living payload safely along with assault equipment and vehicles carried in the cargo holds. Intended to assure such delivery, a Sumpter is built for defense, with ample point weaponry to ward off tracking weapons. Its size also allows for easy landing on most worlds the Azlanti choose to assault. Once troops have been deployed, the Sumpter can be repurposed to transport prisoners for reeducation and, perhaps, sale.
