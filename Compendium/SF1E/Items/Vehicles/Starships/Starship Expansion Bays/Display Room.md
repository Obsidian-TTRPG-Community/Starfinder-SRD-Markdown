## Display Room

**Source**:: _Ports of Call pg. 28_  
**PCU** 1; **Cost (in BP)** 1  
Whether it’s used as a public museum or a private collection, this often-understated room highlights the special few objects placed in it and has comfortable seating for reflection and contemplation. At a GM’s discretion, a display room can be used for the lounge or research downtime activities (Character Operations Manual 153–155).
