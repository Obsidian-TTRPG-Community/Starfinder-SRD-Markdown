# DOSHKO
The traditional weapon of the vesk, the doshko is composed of one to four triangular blades arranged in a row and attached to a long haft. Ideal for devastating overhand blows and catching and parrying enemy weapons, its use is a highly respected art form in traditional vesk society, but it also sees use by creatures of other races as a variant axe. Traditionally, doshkos are made of steel, but in recent decades they have been crafted using advanced metallurgic techniques and even quantum technology to improve the stabbing edges.

Ultrathin doshko blades look exceptionally delicate but hold a fine edge. Zero-edge doshkos appear to have a blurred edge, while molecular rift doshkos have translucent blades. Dimensional blade doshkos have a narrower visible blade, but the solid surrounding aura makes them vicious weapons.
