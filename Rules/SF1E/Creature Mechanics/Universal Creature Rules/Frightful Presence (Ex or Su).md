# FRIGHTFUL PRESENCE (EX OR SU)

**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 153_, _Alien Archive 3 pg. 151_, _Alien Archive 2 pg. 150_, _Alien Archive pg. 154_  
The creature’s presence unsettles its foes. It can activate this ability as part of the action of making an attack or as a move action, but it can activate it only once per round. This ability usually has a range of 30 feet. Opponents within range must succeed at a Will save or become shaken. The duration is 5d6 rounds unless the ability says otherwise. Once an opponent has been exposed to a creature’s frightful presence (whether or not the opponent succeeds at its saving throw), it can’t be affected by the same creature’s frightful presence for 24 hours. This is an emotion, fear, mind-affecting, and sense-dependent effect.

_Format_: **Aura** frightful presence (30 ft., Will DC 22).
