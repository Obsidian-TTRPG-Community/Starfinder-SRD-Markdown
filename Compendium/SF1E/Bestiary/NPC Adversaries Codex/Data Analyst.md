# DATA ANALYST
With three branches—the Constabulary, Ops, and Overwatch— the Stewards protect people and legal rights within the Pact Worlds. The Constabulary handles planet-side troubles, the Overwatch fleet guards Pact Worlds space, and Ops is usually responsible for gathering intelligence. Although Stewards often function as allies for PCs, they might confront PCs engaged in risky heroics, or a canny villain could frame PCs for high crimes to turn Stewards into fearsome adversaries.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Calculate the Odds (Ex)** A data analyst can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to study a creature within 60 feet. Before the end of the data analyst’s next turn, the next time they make an attack against the target and roll a 5 or lower on the attack roll’s die, they can reroll the attack and use the higher result.

## DESCRIPTION

There’s far more to the Stewards than blue-armored enforcers on patrol. Behind the scenes, experts at the Bastion headquarters handle investigations. Periodically, these agents embark on field work to analyze security data, crack datapads, combat technomagical viruses, and study strange phenomena.
