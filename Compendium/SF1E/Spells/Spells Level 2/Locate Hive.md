## Description

This spell was created by formian myrmarchs to prevent workers from getting lost when sent far afield. When you cast this spell, you designate a specific building as your hive. Your hive must be a familiar structure (or starship) that you can picture clearly in your mind. You can have only one hive at a time, and designating a new hive immediately replaces any previous hive. As a full action when you're away from your hive, you can mentally focus on your hive to determine the direction and distance to your hive. If you aren't on the same plane or planetary body as your hive, this spell fails.
