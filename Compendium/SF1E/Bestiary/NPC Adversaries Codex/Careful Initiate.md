SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### Black Hole (SU)

This functions as the solarian stellar revelation of the same name. As a standard action, the careful initiate can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet closer. Each target must succeed a DC 9 Fortitude saving throw or be pulled 10 feet towards the careful initiate.

#### Supernova (SU)

This functions as the solarian stellar revelation of the same name. As a standard action, the careful initiate can deal 2d6 fire damage to all creatures within 10 feet. A creature that succeeds a DC 9 Reflex saving throw takes half damage.

ABOUT

Careful initiates have just learned to harness their powers; they tend to fight to preserve their own health, often at the expense of winning the battle.
