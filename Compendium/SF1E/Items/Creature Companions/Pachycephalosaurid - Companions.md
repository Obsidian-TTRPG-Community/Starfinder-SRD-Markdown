# PACHYCEPHALOSAURID - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 144_  
Pachycephalosaurids are bipedal dinosaurs with thick, domed skulls that can withstand incredible impacts—and be quite dangerous to creatures on the other end of their headbutts. A low center of gravity and wicked talons make pachycephalosaurids popular beasts of burden as well as combat-trained mounts.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Body Slam (Ex)** When you are mounted on your pachycephalosaurid companion and it takes the charge action, it doesn’t take the normal charge penalties to the attack roll or its AC, and it can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver at the end of its movement instead of its normal attack, with a +4 circumstance bonus to the bull rush attempt. The pachycephalosaurid can also add its Strength modifier to this bull rush attempt.

**Headbutt (Ex, 7th level)** When you are mounted on your pachycephalosaurid companion and a foe provokes an attack of opportunity from it, your companion can lower its powerful head and execute a headbutt as a reaction. This headbutt is a melee attack that targets the foe’s KAC and deals bludgeoning damage. If the headbutt hits, add twice your companion’s Strength modifier to the damage dealt (instead of just its Strength modifier).
