### Description

While this _aeon stone_ orbits you, it functions as a comm unit and a tier 3 computer with an artificial personality upgrade that you can access directly through your nervous system without needing a user interface. While the stone orbits you, you are aware of any attempt to connect to it and can grant access if you wish. This computer can be upgraded as normal, and the upgrades are all magical. The stone is magically powered, so the computer doesn’t need a power source.
