## Description

The product of a decade of Ringworks research and development, the Specter represents the first known successful use of quantum defender technology on a capital ship. Previous efforts, notably by firms on Eox and in the Veskarium, avoided losses by designing semiautomated test models flown by virtual intelligences. These test vessels invariably self-destructed, merged with an asteroid or other piece of solid matter, or vanished forever.  
  
Vercite scientist Mulreen Bonasi finally managed to stabilize the quantum defender by linking it to the Drift engine, funneling any undesired quantum interactions into the Drift itself. Bonasi’s critics expressed outrage at the unknown peril of filling the Drift with unpredictable quantum forces, but Ringworks eagerly funded Bonasi’s patent and hired her as lead researcher for their Specter project.  
  
Automated drones weren’t enough to test this technology within a large vessel, however, and the moral implications of attaching a true artificial intelligence to a potentially doomed voyage were too grim to ignore. Teams of volunteers agreed to crew Specter prototypes in a series of experimental flights. Luckily most of the trials fared without incident, but the ill-fated Cyan Echo team failed to phase back after its quantum jaunt; those 180 souls have been presumed lost, along with their ship.  
  
Despite this tragedy, the Specter is ready to enter service as part of the Verces fleet as both a combatant and personnel carrier. Errant Eoxian scientists, frustrated by their previous failures and further antagonized by the craft’s ghostly name, recently hired teams of spies and saboteurs to steal Specter technology. Though officially condemned by the Eoxian government, engineering teams stand by in Corpse Fleet outposts, ready to dissemble Bonasi’s masterpiece should their agents successfully hijack a Specter.
