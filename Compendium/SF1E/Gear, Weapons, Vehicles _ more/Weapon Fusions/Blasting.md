Effect: The _blasting_ fusion allows a weapon to make a single attack as a blast (see the blast weapon special property on page 180) once per day as a full action. This attack has a maximum range of 30 feet and deals half the weapon’s normal damage. Only ranged weapons that don’t have the automatic, explode, line, or thrown weapon special property can benefit from the _blasting_ fusion. Weapons that don’t require attack rolls to affect their targets also can’t benefit from the _blasting_ fusion.
