Travelers on alien worlds must be prepared to confront a variety of difficult environments. This long-range powered armor resembles a humanoid torso atop several bristly metal tendrils ending in sharp, grasping claws. The armor has comfortable seating and a supply of nutritious paste delivered intravenously while wearing an explorer’s cradle, you do not need to eat or drink. As a standard action, you can extend and reshape the tentacles into a variety of forms resembling limbs, fins, or wings, gaining one of the following abilities until you next rearrange the tentacles.  
  
**Bladed Strikes**: The damage dealt by this armor increases to 4d8 slashing damage.  
  
: You gain a climb speed of 20 feet.  
  
**Creeping Legs**: Your movement is not slowed by difficult terrain, although you still cannot run or charge through difficult terrain.  
  
**Fluttering Wings**: The tentacles splay out behind you and form connective membranes to create wings, granting you a fly speed of 20 feet with clumsy maneuverability.  
  
**Undulating Tendrils**: You gain a swim speed of 20 feet.
