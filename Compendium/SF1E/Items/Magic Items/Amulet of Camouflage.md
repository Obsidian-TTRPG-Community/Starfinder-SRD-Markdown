### Description

This modest amulet projects a simple pattern over your outer layers of armor, clothing, and equipment, which helps you blend into the background. When in an environment with a maximum distance at which Perception checks can be attempted, rolls to see at what range other creatures can attempt Perception checks against you are rolled twice, and the lower result applies. See Chapter 11 for more information on the Perception ranges of different environments. The amulet’s magic isn’t powerful enough to make you invisible or grant a bonus to Stealth checks. You can activate or deactivate this camouflage as a standard action.
