# Asteroid Louse

Even the vacuum of space has bugs. Most of these void-dwelling vermin are harmless, but some are dangerous or predatory.

Asteroid lice and planetoid beetles feed on minerals in the rock of their airless habitats. Asteroid lice are communal, but planetoid beetles are territorial, tolerating only one mate. These creatures and their eggs can float in space to a new home. However, careless quarrying and shipping have accelerated their spread through the galaxy.

Xenobiologists theorize many space vermin evolved in special circumstances. Necropedes were once centipede-like scavengers on Eox; they now have a bite that can digest undead flesh. A warpmoth is like a glowing blue-white speck attracted to moving light, such as other warpmoths or passing starships. Gathering in swarms and following ships helps the moths feed and mate. Comet wasps create nests in frozen interstellar bodies. These icy, venomous vespids lay their eggs in living creatures.

**Break Objects (Ex)** When attacking an object, an asteroid louse treats that object’s hardness as 10 lower.

**Caustic Remains (Ex)** The remains of an asteroid louse are caustic and stay so for 5 rounds. This acid affects inorganic material and flesh. Creatures or items that touch the remains take 1d4 acid damage that treats hardness as 10 lower than it is. Anything in contact with the acid for a full round instead takes 8 acid damage.

**Consume Objects (Ex)** An asteroid louse can eat objects with a hardness of 10 or lower. It deals 1 damage per minute to an object it’s consuming. An asteroid louse is sated and stops feeding on a given day after dealing 100 damage this way.
