# GRAVITY SHIELD
**Source** _Near Space pg. 151_  
As they were invented by the copaxi of Tabrid Minor, most _gravity shields_ appear to be crafted of large pieces of coral. A _gravity shield_ is a hybrid item that can mimic the gravity-manipulating powers of copi. You can use a gravity shield to make a special unarmed attack that does not count as archaic and can deal your choice of either bludgeoning or piercing damage.  
In addition, three times per day as a standard action, you can increase the relative gravity of the shield and attempt a disarm combat maneuver against an adjacent opponent. If you are successful, the disarmed item sticks to your shield for 1 round before it falls to the ground, during which time you can use a swift action to retrieve the item with a free hand. The _basic_ and _field gravity shields_ grant a +1 circumstance bonus to the disarm attack roll and the _advanced_ and _elite gravity shields_ grant a +2 circumstance bonus to the disarm attack roll.
