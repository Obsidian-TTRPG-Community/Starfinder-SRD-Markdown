## Gargantuan Herd Animal Cr 6

source: Alien Archive 2 
From the ruthigs of Castrovel to the wollipeds of Triaxus, herd animals are beasts that gather in social groups comprised entirely of creatures of the same species. Herding behavior allows animals to gather and move together for protection from predators. Most commonly, herd animals are herbivores or docile omnivores. Predator statistics better represent fiercer animals, including aggressive herbivores and omnivores that may or may not move in groups of their own kind.
In the Pact Worlds, the most common herd animals are domesticated. When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.
More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets’ ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet’s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments.
