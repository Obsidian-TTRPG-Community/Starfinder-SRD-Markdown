### Description

Used for cooking or warming up food, this large metal pot is equipped with four sealed nodes containing a variety of chemicals. When the pot is activated, these chemicals combine, creating a chemical reaction that heats the contents of the pot without needing additional power. A dial on the side of the pot enables you to adjust the potâ€™s temperature by controlling how much of the chemicals interact with one another. A self-heating pot is typically large enough to hold and heat a maximum of 10 gallons.
