## Description

This spell functions as _hoverdisk_, except as noted above. As part of casting this spell, you can give a single set of instructions to all disks, or you can give separate instructions to each disk. You must spend a standard action to give new or additional instructions to any one disk, although you can give a group of disks the same instructions as part of the same action.
