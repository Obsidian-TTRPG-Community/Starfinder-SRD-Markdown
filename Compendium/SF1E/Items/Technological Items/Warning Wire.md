# Warning Wire

This 50 feet of thin, nearly invisible wire is spooled around a dull-gray, flat metal cylinder. When any amount of the wire is unspooled and the cylinder is activated, the wire becomes exceptionally sensitive to vibration. The wire is often wrapped around valuable belongings or stretched as a trip wire across a doorway. When the activated wire is moved or touched, the cylinder emits a piercing alarm (though you can set it to send a silent alarm wirelessly to a comm unit or datapad instead). Noticing the warning wire requires a successful Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + the level of the warning wire, and bypassing it without setting it off usually requires a successful Acrobatics check at the same DC, though the GM might adjust the DC higher or lower as circumstances dictate. You can twist the cylinder in a preset pattern as a move action, deactivating the alarm and respooling the wire around the cylinder.
