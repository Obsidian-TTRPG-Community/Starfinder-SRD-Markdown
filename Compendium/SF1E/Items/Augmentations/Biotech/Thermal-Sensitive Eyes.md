# Thermal-sensitive Eyes

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 59_  
**Level**:: 7
**Price**::  6500 
**System**:: Eyes  
Your eyes become especially sensitive to relatively slight fluctuations in temperature. You can see through non-magical fog, mist, and clouds without penalty, ignoring any cover or concealment bonuses those effects would provide to other creatures. In addition, if you have darkvision, the range of your darkvision is doubled.
