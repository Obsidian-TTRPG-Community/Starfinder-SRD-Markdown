### Description

These cargo haulers are used predominantly on planets with ultra-dense, carbon dioxide-rich atmospheres. Dense atmospheres allow the wingships to carry heavy loads as basic ground-effect vehicles, providing significant cost savings over orbital launch or true anti-grav propulsion. They’re often hardened against the toxic atmospheres of the planets they operate on and can carry several hundred tons of cargo at speed.
