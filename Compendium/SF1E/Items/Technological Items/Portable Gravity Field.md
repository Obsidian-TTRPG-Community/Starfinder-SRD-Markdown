### Description

This compact, spherical cartridge of black nanocarbon surrounds a central chamber that contains compressed dark matter. When activated as a standard action, a portable gravity field temporarily increases the gravitational forces in an area by one step (zero to light, light to standard, standard to heavy, and heavy to extreme) in a 20-ft. radius burst. This effect lasts until the device runs out of charges or until it’s deactivated as a move action. This item has no effect in an area that already has extreme gravity.
