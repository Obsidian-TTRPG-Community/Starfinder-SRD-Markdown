## Description

When the target uses aid another, covering fire, or harrying fire, and succeeds at their attack roll or skill check, they can forgo granting their ally the usual benefit of that action to instead grant the following benefits, determined by the action they used. Any effect that increases the bonuses provided by these actions doesn't apply when using this spell. The target can provide these benefits only to allies with whom they can communicate in person.

_Aid Another_: Instead of gaining a bonus to a skill check, the ally can roll the check twice and use the higher result.

_Covering Fire_: Instead of granting a bonus to the ally's AC, the next opponent to attack the chosen ally must roll the attack twice and use the lower result.

_Harrying Fire_: Instead of gaining a bonus to an attack roll, the next ally to attack the chosen opponent can roll the attack twice and use the higher result.
