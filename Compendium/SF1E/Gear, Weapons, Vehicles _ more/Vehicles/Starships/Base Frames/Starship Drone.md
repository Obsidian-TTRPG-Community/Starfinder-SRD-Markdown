### SPECIAL ABILITIES

A starship made with the starship drone base frame has no life support, artificial gravity, or crew quarters. All its components are accessible from outside the ship, usually through maintenance hatches and other access ports. A starship drone is usually equipped with a VI, or virtual intelligence system. The ship’s VI obeys instructions according to its programming, but it can navigate and use onboard systems when supervision isn’t available.
