Quorlus have developed gauntlets that store and amplify ambient heat, unleashing it in hand-to-hand combat. Notorious for their use of these weapons, quorlu infiltrators and sappers also use heat-amp gauntlets to start fires to hinder their enemies.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
