The translucent crystal network in a resonant gauntlet has its origins in the rings of the gas giant Liavara. The rings contain crystal fragments thought to record every sonic vibration that passes through them. Researchers have yet to fully decode the information they hold, but they have been able to develop a material that shares some of the crystal’s properties.

A resonant gauntlet is a long glove with composited crystal and metal around the user’s wrist, forearm, and knuckles. When a wearer strikes, the composite generates a harmful resonance that can be directed into a target’s body, rupturing cell walls and causing organ stress. The wearer can increase the effect by flexing the limb and digits under the gauntlet, causing the crystal to record the subtle sounds of the body and its component matter to build stronger resonance. The cellular resonance gauntlet is the basic model. Focused frequencies of the molecular, atomic, and quantum models stimulate respectively smaller components of matter to deal correspondingly large amounts of damage.

# Sonic Weapons

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
