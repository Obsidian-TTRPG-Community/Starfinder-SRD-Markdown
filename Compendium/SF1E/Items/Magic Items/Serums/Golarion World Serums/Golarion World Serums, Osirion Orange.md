# Golarion World Serums, Osirion Orange

**Level**:: 3
**Price**:: 250
**Bulk**:: L

### Description

The label of this citrusy beverage features a shambling cartoon mummy wrapped in orange-tinged bandages, and a bit of cloth trailing from it appears caught on a tiny pyramid. Beneath that is written, “Lift the curse of thirst!” The serum grants you a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of creatures with the earth subtype.
