# Emissary

Diplomats are ambassadors for their people, working to establish better relationships with those from other cultures, find ways for groups to collaborate, and realize peaceful solutions when violence seems imminent. Given the stakes for fumbling a negotiation, diplomats are highly trained professionals who are equally capable of charming others and evading political traps.  
However, diplomats aren’t necessarily the PCs’ allies. An evil empire might employ diplomats who suppress internal dissent and international complaints through clever misdirection. Diplomats might introduce well-intentioned political entanglements in defense of their own objectives, even if these limit the PCs’ abilities to thwart some greater evil. A diplomat is often a non-combat threat, challenging PCs to employ logic, guile, and charm to discourage, discredit, or sway their rival.

## Description

Emissaries are professional negotiators who communicate, advocate for, and verbally defend their patron’s interests. This might require appearing before a trade commission to dispute a contract, courting Pact Council favor to push for a planet’s admission as a protectorate, or smoothing over an awkward incident. More often, an emissary plays a subtle and sustained role by building connections and keeping their patron on another party’s figurative radar. Whatever their objectives, these diplomats do whatever is necessary to fulfill their mission.
