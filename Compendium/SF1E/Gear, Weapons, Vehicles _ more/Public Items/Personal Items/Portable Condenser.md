### DESCRIPTION

This wearable device consists of a 1-quart tank, a coolant pack, a standard battery, and a hose. When powered, the tank absorbs and filters moisture from the surrounding atmosphere, condensing it into potable water. The device condenses 1 quart of water per hour, using 2 charges per hour, and shutting off automatically once the tank is full. In especially dry areas, this process takes twice as long, and the device cannot function in a vacuum or where there is no atmospheric moisture at all. Most deserts hold enough ambient moisture for the device to function at its slower rate.
