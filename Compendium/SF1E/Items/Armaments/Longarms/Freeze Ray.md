# Freeze Ray

Across the galaxy, practically every sufficiently advanced civilization has created its own variation of the freeze ray. All freeze rays function in a similar way, emitting a long line of supercooled gas, but individual models reflect their species’ design aesthetics. In the Pact Worlds, the most common models reflect the slim profile of Vercite technology or the bony protrusions of Eoxian design. Hiemal, algid, and glacial freeze rays simply produce an extreme reduction in the temperature along the weapon’s line of effect. Isothermal freeze rays cause a persistent temperature drop, dealing further damage, while hypothermic freeze rays causes multiple temperature reductions in rapid succession for further increased destruction.

### Cryo Weapons

Cryo weapons generate blasts of supercooled gas that can damage or incapacitate a target. The gas is kept within a charged cryochamber attached to the weapon. While primitive models simply sprayed these freezing chemicals like a flamethrower, modern models use a containment beam to deliver deadly frozen particles to targets at impressive ranges. Most cryo weapons automatically replenish their reservoirs of reactive chemicals by drawing and processing various gases from the atmosphere, needing only batteries to maintain their ammunition supply.

One of the most popular lines of cryo weapons are zero weapons, including zero cannons, pistols, and rifles. In common parlance, avalanche-class cryo weapons are the coldest and most dangerous, followed in descending order by blizzard-class, hailstorm-class, and frostbite-class cryo weapons.
