# Psychokinetic Sleeve

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 93_  
**Level**:: 14
**Price**::  75000 
**System**:: Arm and hand  
A mesh of starmetal-alloy fibers inserted under your skin connects to the nerves of your arm and hand. As a standard action, you can attempt a ranged attack with a range increment of 60 feet that acts as a bull rush, disarm, grapple (including pin), or trip combat maneuver. You can add your key ability score modifier to this attack roll instead of your Strength modifier if it is higher. If you successfully disarm an item, you can’t automatically catch it. If you successfully grapple a target, the condition doesn’t end if you move and the target can’t try to grapple you in return. The DC of the Acrobatics check to escape the grapple is 31. Once you use your _psychokinetic sleeve_, you can’t use it again until you have rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point at any point to recharge it immediately.
