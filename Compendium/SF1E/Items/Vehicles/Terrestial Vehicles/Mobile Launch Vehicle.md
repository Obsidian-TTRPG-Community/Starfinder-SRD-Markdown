### Description

A mobile launch vehicle is one of the cheapest available platforms by which to transport, maintain, and deploy a mech, with little more than crew quarters and an engineering bay. Due to the hangar bay being significantly taller than the launch facilities and surrounding vehicle, its design often invites comparisons to snails and other shelled creatures.
