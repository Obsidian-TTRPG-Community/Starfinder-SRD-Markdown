### DESCRIPTION
While even professional hoverskaters are encouraged to wear simple safety gear when performing tricks, these advanced technological helmets are sold to those who attempt the most extreme stunts. When you fall while wearing a shock-absorbing helmet, you can convert the first 1d6 bludgeoning damage to nonlethal bludgeoning damage; this conversion is cumulative with damage reduced through deliberate jumps, successful Acrobatics checks, and other means (see shock-absorbing pads, below). This requires no charges. In addition, as a reaction when you’re struck by a wound critical hit effect that targets your brain, you can activate the shock-absorbing foam within the helmet, consuming 1 charge and allowing you to roll the Fortitude saving throw twice and take the better result.|
