# Giant, Moon Giant

Giants are humanoid creatures with great strength and mighty stature, standing from 9 feet to over 25 feet tall. They often live apart from other races, as even space stations intended to be inclusive of multiple species are often too small to comfortably accommodate a giant’s massive size. How welcoming these giants are to non-giant visitors depends on the specific giant society, though all giants can be unpredictable and dangerous to others.

### Special Abilities

**Hurl Debris (Ex)** The mighty strength of a giant allows it to turn nearly anything into a ranged weapon. A giant is assumed to have such debris available (either loose or readily torn from the environment without requiring an extra action) unless the GM rules otherwise. Hurled debris has a range increment equal to the giant’s Strength modifier × 5 feet. Such attacks also create difficult terrain in a 5-foot-radius area around the target, or a 10-foot-radius area for Huge and larger giants.

**Lunar Aura (Su)** Creatures within 60 feet of a moon giant are affected by its lunar aura as long as they remain within range. A creature that succeeds at its save against the aura is immune to that particular moon giant’s lunar aura for 24 hours. A moon giant can change the effect of the aura as a swift action, and the giant can choose whether to include itself as part of the same swift action. The giant can choose one of the following effects.

_Waning_: Affected creatures fall asleep as deep slumber. The giant’s lunar aura is not limited by CR or Hit Dice.  
_Waxing_: Affected creatures gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to the giant’s CR and gain the ability to make three attacks during a full attack, though each attack takes a –5 penalty (instead of a –4 penalty).
