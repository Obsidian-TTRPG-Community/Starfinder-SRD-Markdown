# Social Reset

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 82_  
**Classes**:: Mystic 2, Precog 2  
**School**:: divination  
**Casting-Time**:: 1 reaction  
**Range**:: personal  
**Duration**:: instantaneous  

## Description

You can recover from social blunders and cultural misinterpretations so quickly, as if they never happened. When you fail a Culture check to recall information, or a Diplomacy check to change attitude or gather information, you can cast this spell to reroll the failed check. You can't cast this spell again until you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.
