# PHASE GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 145_  
**Item Level** 10; **Price** 17,500; **System** Skin  
Grays can walk through solid objects. Thousands of charged filaments threaded throughout your skin give you the ability to shift yourself out of phase with this reality. As a reaction to being attacked, you can gain a 20% miss chance against that attack. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1).
