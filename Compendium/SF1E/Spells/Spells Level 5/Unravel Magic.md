## DESCRIPTION

You unravel the magic imbuing a magic item, permanently removing its magical properties. To do so, you must attempt a caster level check (1d20 + your caster level). The DC equals 11 + the item's level, or 5 + a consumable item's level. If you succeed, the item becomes nonmagical, but its physical properties remain unchanged. This spell has no effect on artifacts.

If you unravel a non-consumable magic item of an item level of 4 or higher, you can harvest a portion of the unraveling energy. Divide the item's level by 4, and you can gain one spell slot of that level or lower. That spell slot vanishes if you fail to use it within 24 hours or after you rest to regain the use of daily-use abilities, whichever comes first.
