## Description

With this spell, common among shirren mystics, you transmit your emotions into the surrounding area, allowing you to empathically communicate with others. You gain a +2 insight bonus to ability or skill checks other than Bluff made to communicate with any creature, whether you share a language or not, and all creatures gain a +4 insight bonus to Sense Motive checks made to read your body language, emotions, or motives. If you have limited telepathy, creatures within 30 feet of you sense and comprehend your emotions clearly. A creature that has telepathy or limited telepathy and is within 30 feet can understand your emotions clearly.
