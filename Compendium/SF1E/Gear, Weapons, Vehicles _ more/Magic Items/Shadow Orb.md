### DESCRIPTION

While you hold this small orb of black glass, it puts forth tendrils of darkness that capture nearby light. The light level within a 20-foot radius of you decreases by one step. Lasers fired at you are bent toward the orb. This gives laser attacks against you a +1 circumstance bonus to hit, but also grants you fire resistance 5 against laser attacks.
