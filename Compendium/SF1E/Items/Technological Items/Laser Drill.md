### Description

A laser drill is a handheld item that resembles a snub-nosed pistol. As a standard action, you can use the drill to create a hole 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch deep in stationary and unattended materials with a hardness of 15 or less, such as concrete, plastic, or wood. At the GM’s discretion, you might be able to use a laser drill on harder materials as a full action or longer. Detecting a laser drill at work requires a successful DC 15 Perception check. A laser drill isn’t generally useful in combat, but it can deal 1 fire damage with a successful melee attack as an improvised weapon.
