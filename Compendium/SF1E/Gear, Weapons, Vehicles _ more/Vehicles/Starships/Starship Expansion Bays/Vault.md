# VAULT
**PCU** 3; **Cost (in BP)** 2  
Some crews need a secure vault to store valuables. Breaking into a vault generally requires two skill checks (determined by the GM, though Computers and Engineering are common) with a DC equal to 10 + 1-1/2 × the ship’s tier. Failing either check by 5 or more sets off alarms, alerting the whole ship.
