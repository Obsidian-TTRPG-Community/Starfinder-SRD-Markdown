## Description

When you cast this spell, choose acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The spell gains that descriptor. You summon a minor hazard from an alternate reality, creating a splash of acid rain, a blast of freezing air, a static electric discharge, a burst of fire, or a roar of thunder. Each creature in the area must succeed at a Reflex save or take 1d3 damage of the chosen type.
