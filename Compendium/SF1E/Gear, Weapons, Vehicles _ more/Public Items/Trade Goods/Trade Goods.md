# TRADE GOODS
Trade goods can normally be sold for their full value, subject to the GMâ€™s discretion. These are given only as common baselines, most applicable to the [[Pact Worlds]], as regional variances can have a significant impact on the value of trade goods.

``` dataview
TABLE
Category, Price
FROM "Pact Worlds & Beyond/Public Items/Trade Goods"
SORT Category ASC
WHERE file.name != "Trade Goods"
```
