# Absorb Force Graft

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 140_  
**Item Level** 3;
**Price**::  1,350; **System** All Hands  
Witchwyrds can catch magic missiles (from the spell of the same name), and mystical dampeners installed let you do the same. As a reaction, you can use any number of your free hands to catch magic missiles fired at you. Doing so absorbs the missile and manifests as a glowing nimbus around that hand (which is no longer considered free) until the beginning of your next turn. To use this ability, you must be aware of the incoming magic missiles and can’t be flat-footed. This augmentation works best with the force bolt graft.
