# Overlord

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 87_  
You realize that not all connections are symmetrical, and seek to be the dominant force in any situation. You aren’t necessarily evil; perhaps you consider yourself a benevolent philosophermonarch who takes control for the good of your charges. You might also be a cult leader, a criminal mastermind, or a hypnotist.

**Associated Deities**: Abadar, Besmara, Damoritosh, Lao Shu Po, Zon-Kuthon  
**Associated Skills**:

Diplomacy and Intimidate  
**Spells**: 1st - _Command_, 2nd - _Hold Person_, 3rd - _Suggestion_, 4th - _Confusion_, 5th - _Dominate Person_, 6th - _Suggestion, Mass_

## Inexplicable Commands (SU) - 1ST Level

When one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities ends, the target loses all memory that it was magically controlled or influenced. That creature still remembers the actions it took, but may be confused by them.  

## Forced Amity (SP) - 3RD Level

You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a standard action to shunt positive emotions and thoughts through your connection, forcing a humanoid creature to become friendly to you for a time. This functions as _charm person_.  

## Echoes of Obedience (SU) - 6TH Level

Even creatures that resist your dominance can’t shake the lingering echoes of your mind. When a creature succeeds at a saving throw against one of your mind-affecting charm or compulsion spells or spell-like abilities and negates the effect, it takes a –1 penalty to AC, attack rolls, and skill checks until the beginning of your next turn. This is a mind-affecting effect.  

## Greater Forced Amity (SP) - 9TH Level

Your forced amity ability functions as _charm monster_.  

## Jealous Overlord (SU) - 12TH Level

When an ally linked by your telepathic bond class feature is subject to mind-affecting effect that issues commands, as a reaction you can issue a countermand allowing the linked ally to act normally. When you do, attempt an opposed Charisma check against the originator of the mind-affecting effect; if you succeed, your ally can act normally.  

## Forceful Commands (SU) - 15TH Level

When you use a mind-affecting charm or compulsion spell or spell-like ability against a target benefiting from an active spell that protects against your attack, you automatically become aware of the presence of such defenses, and can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of casting the spell to attempt a caster level check to dispel the highest-level such spell, as if you had cast _dispel magic_.  

## Absolute Control (SU) - 18TH Level

When you issue a command to a dominated creature that would force it to act against its nature, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to deny it a new saving throw against your domination. The dominated creature still won’t carry out an obviously self-destructive order.
