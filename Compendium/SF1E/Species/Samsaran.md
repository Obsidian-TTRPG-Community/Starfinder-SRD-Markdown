Samsarans are mysterious humanoids who experience an endless cycle of birth to death to rebirth. When a samsaran dies, they reincarnate into a young samsaran to live a new life. The memories of their past lives are hazy and indistinct, but most samsarans seek lives of balance and enlightenment to ensure their continuing rebirth.
