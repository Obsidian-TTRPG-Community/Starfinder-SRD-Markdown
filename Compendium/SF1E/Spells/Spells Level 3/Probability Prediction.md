# Probability Prediction

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 369_  
**Classes**:: Precog 3, Technomancer 3, Witchwarper 3  
**School**:: divination  
**Casting-Time**:: 1 standard action  
**Range**:: personal  
**Duration**:: 1 round/level (D); see text  

## Description

You open your mind to read the underlying probability of the universe. At any point during the duration of this spell, you can discharge it to reroll any one of your d20 rolls (attack roll, saving throw, skill check, etc.); see page 243. This takes no action, but you must choose to do it before you learn the results of the first roll. You must take the result of the second roll, even if it is worse.
