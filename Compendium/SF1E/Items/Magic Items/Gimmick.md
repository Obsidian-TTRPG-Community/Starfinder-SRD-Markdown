A gimmick is a small, handheld item, usable only by spellcasters, that focuses their spellcasting in a unique way. When you cast a spell, you can channel the magic through one gimmick you’re holding to alter the spell, both changing any perceptible manifestations and effects in a specific way based on the gimmick. Once used to modify a spell, a gimmick can’t be used again until after you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points, though you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge an attuned gimmick without spending an action.  
A gimmick requires time to attune to a new user, functioning only once it has been in your possession for at least 24 hours. However, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to attune to a new gimmick with only 10 minutes of concentration. Once attuned to you, the gimmick takes a shape of your choice that reflects your personality and spellcasting tradition, appearing as a wand, mystical orb, engineering tool, or the like. A gimmick can’t be shaped into a functioning weapon, though it can take a weapon-like appearance. A technomancer can turn a gimmick into their spell cache by performing an 8-hour ritual, though if the gimmick spell cache is lost or destroyed, a newly created spell cache no longer has the gimmick’s properties.

### Description

The simplest gimmick merely personalizes your magic, giving spells channeled through the gimmick a sensory theme you choose while attuning it (such as gambling to make magic missiles look like flaming cards or make your augury result manifest like reels on a holographic slot machine). These sensory extras don’t otherwise change the spell’s effects.

### Description

This gimmick gives your damaging spells a small chance of inflicting devastating harm, giving the channeled spell a critical hit effect based on the spell’s damage type: corrode for acid damage, staggered for cold damage, arc for electricity damage, burn for fire damage, deafen for sonic damage, knockdown for bludgeoning or force damage, bleed for piercing damage, and wound for slashing damage. For a critical hit effect that deals additional damage, such as arc or bleed, the additional damage equals 1d6 per spell level (or 1d4 for a 0-level spell). If a spell deals multiple types of damage or would already apply a different critical hit effect, you can apply one of the applicable critical hit effects of your choice when you score a critical hit. If the channeled spell doesn’t require an attack roll but instead allows a saving throw to reduce its damage, you can apply the critical hit effect to one affected creature that rolls a natural 1 on its saving throw.  
Unlike with most gimmicks, if the channeled spell does not score a critical hit against any target, then the gimmick’s power is not expended, and another spell can be channeled through it. The maximum level spell that a devastating gimmick can modify is based on its model.  
The gimmick can modify a spell of 2nd level or lower.

When you channel a spell through the gimmick, choose one type of damage dealt by the spell; the spell deals an equal amount of damage of the gimmick’s type instead, and the spell gains that energy type’s descriptor. The maximum level spell that an elemental gimmick can modify is based on its model.

### Description

This gimmick helps direct the channeled spell, enhancing its accuracy. Make your attacks with the channeled spell as if your base attack bonus from the associated spellcasting class were equal to your levels in that class (such as a 5th-level technomancer treating their BAB from technomancer levels as +5 rather than +3 for a channeled technomancer spell). The maximum level spell a targeting gimmick can modify is based on its model.  
The gimmick can modify a spell of 2nd level or lower.

The gimmick can modify a spell of 3rd level or lower.
