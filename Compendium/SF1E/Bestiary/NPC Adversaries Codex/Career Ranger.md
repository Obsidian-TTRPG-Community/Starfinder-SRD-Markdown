# Career Ranger

Survivalists are defined by independence and self-sufficiency. They often expertly navigate specific types of hostile or dangerous terrain: forests, deserts, or more remote locales such as dead space or post-apocalyptic cityscapes. Survivalists generally don’t rely on others and commonly live and work alone. However, the following statistics can represent hunters and warriors within a community as well as hermits. A survivalist might have some kind of sentient companion or a creature companion, such as a beast of burden or a hunting beast. A survivalist might arrive at a critical moment to help PCs as they travel through a barren wasteland. Alternatively, a survivalist makes an excellent antagonist in a wilderness setting since they’re capable of using every aspect of the environment against their foes.

## Description

Career rangers are self-sufficient and at home in the wilderness. They excel at guerrilla tactics, such as crafting traps and setting ambushes for prey or enemies. A career ranger might be an isolated loner in the middle of nowhere or a vital member of a rural community. Career rangers in smaller communities are often responsible for scouting and hunting to keep their communities safe and fed.
