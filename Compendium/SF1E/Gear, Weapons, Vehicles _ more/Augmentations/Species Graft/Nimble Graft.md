# NIMBLE GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 145_  
**Item Level** 1; **Price** 375; **System** All Feet  
The catlike pahtra are agile and graceful, even in low or zero gravity. Small hoverjets in your feet (or similar appendages) afford you similar responsiveness. When you are knocked off-kilter, you don’t gain the flat-footed condition or take the normal penalty to attacks. In addition, you can steady yourself as a swift action instead of a move action.
