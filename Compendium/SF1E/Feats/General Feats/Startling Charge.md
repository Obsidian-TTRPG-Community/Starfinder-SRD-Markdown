Benefit: When you charge as a full action, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a creature within your melee reach at the end of the charge, rather than making a melee attack. If you succeed at your Intimidate check, the target is shaken for 1 additional round and you gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls to resolve combat maneuvers against the target until the end of your next turn.

# STARTLING CHARGE
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 135_  
You use your charge mainly to frighten your enemies rather than to attack them directly.

**Prerequisites**: Str 13, Intimidate 1 rank, ferocious charge universal creature rule

**Benefit**: When you charge as a full action, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a creature within your melee reach at the end of the charge, rather than making a melee attack. If you succeed at your Intimidate check, the target is shaken for 1 additional round and you gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls to resolve combat maneuvers against the target until the end of your next turn.

**Special**: If you have an ability that allows you to charge without taking penalties to your attack roll or AC (such as the charge attack ability from the soldierâ€™s blitz fighting style), you qualify for this feat as though you had the ferocious charge ability.
