## Description

Robot dragons are incredibly complex artificial constructs so advanced they attract a dragon’s soul upon completion, much like android bodies. Each is built around a specific category of weapon. The creation of such creatures is a nearly lost art, and while robot dragons are often built as weapons of war to serve specific groups, they inevitably become independent.
