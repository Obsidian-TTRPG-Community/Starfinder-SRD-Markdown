# Nanite Capsules

| D6 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1  | Attempt a Constitution saving throw with a DC equal to 10 + half your level. On a failure, you gain the shaken condition. On a success, you experience only a bitter taste and a strange tingling throughout your body.      |
| 2  | Your skin gains an odd, gray pallor (or if already gray, it becomes weirdly iridescent). You take a –2 penalty to Diplomacy and Stealth checks.                                                                              |
| 3  | Your physical capabilities are bolstered. Once during the duration, you can reroll a failed Fortitude or Reflex saving throw.                                                                                                |
| 4  | Nanites focus on maintaining your structural integrity. The first time you take Hit Point damage during the duration, you gain fast healing equal to one-quarter your character level (minimum fast healing 1) for 1 minute. |
| 5  | A surge of nanites through your body helps you achieve extraordinary results. Once during the duration, before attempting a skill or ability check, you can take a reaction to gain a +2 circumstance bonus to that check.   |
| 6  | Nanites form a protective shell around your weakest areas. You gain 25 temporary Hit Points (or 30 if you’re a construct) that expire at the end of the duration.                                                            |
