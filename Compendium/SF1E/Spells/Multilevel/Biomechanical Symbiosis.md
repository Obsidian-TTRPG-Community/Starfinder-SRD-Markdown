## DESCRIPTION

You energize the targetâ€™s natural healing. For 5 rounds, the target gains fast healing and electricity resistance based on the spell slot used to cast the spell. If the target is a plant, the spell instead lasts for 1d6+4 rounds, and the spell removes one condition affecting the target that could be ended with lesser remove condition. Casting this spell drains all charges from a fully charged battery, otherwise it fails.  
**2nd:** The spell grants fast healing 2 and electricity resistance 5, and drains a standard battery.  
**4th:** The spell grants fast healing 4 and electricity resistance 10, and drains a high-capacity battery. The spell can end one condition affecting a plant target as though it were remove condition.  
**6th:** The spell grants fast healing 6 and electricity resistance 15, and drains an ultra-capacity battery. The spell can end one condition affecting a plant target as though it were greater remove condition.
