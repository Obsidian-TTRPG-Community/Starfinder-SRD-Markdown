Forged and constructed from supernatural metals collected from the realms of the fey, this powered armor has long antlers atop its blank-faced helmet. If the armor has at least 10 charges remaining, you can spend 10 charges to create a fold in reality, per the _dimension door_ spell. You can travel only 100 feet with this ability, and you can’t take other creatures with you. Once you have used this ability, the _stag-step suit_ retains a charge of dimensional static that prevents you from using the armor’s ability again for 24 hours.
