## DESCRIPTION

You instantly teleport from your current location to any other spot within range, be that a place you visualize or simply by deciding a direction and distance. You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed your maximum load. You leave behind an insubstantial image of yourself in your previous space until the end of your next turn. This image’s features are too washed out to be mistaken for you, and it can’t be harmed (though it can be dispelled). While it lasts, you can perceive the image’s surroundings, flank nearby creatures, and target spells as if you still occupied its space.
