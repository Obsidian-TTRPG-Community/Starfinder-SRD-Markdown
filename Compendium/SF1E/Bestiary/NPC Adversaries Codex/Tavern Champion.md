SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### Bluster (EX)

As a move action, a tavern champion can brag about their own abilities or hurl a stinging insult at an opponent. If they succeed at a Bluff check with a DC equal to 15 + their target’s CR, they gain a +1 to hit and a +1 to damage their target for 1 round.

#### Orc Ferocity (EX)

Once per day, a half-orc brought to 0 Hit Points but not killed can fight on for 1 more round. The half-orc drops to 0 HP and is dying (following the normal rules for death and dying) but can continue to act normally until the end of her next turn, when she becomes unconscious as normal. If she takes additional damage before this, she ceases to be able to act and falls unconscious.

ABOUT

A tavern champion is locally famous for boxing, throwing darts, arm wrestling, or just coming out on top in a bar fight. If she’s not in the mood to fight—for example, if she’s just trying to enjoy a meal or drink with friends—she prefers to intimidate rivals into backing down, but still enjoys a good brawl and knocks out anyone who doesn’t take no for an answer.

Often found in seedy bars and back alley gambling houses, tavern champions tend to succeed in life by bullying easy targets, making lucky bets, and promoting their own image through any means necessary. When confronted with another powerful presence, they often feel the need to assert their own dominance to prove who is the better person. This assertion often comes with violence.
