## DESCRIPTION

When kasatha sojourners finally reached Akiton, they found the planet they hoped to settle already inhabited by technologically advanced species. While many chose to integrate into Akiton’s society and the nascent Pact Worlds at large, a minority faction advocated for the Idari to power back up and continue searching for a new, uncontested home world. Although this group failed to convince the ruling Doyenate to start the Idari on a new journey, the Doyenate saw the wisdom in continuing the search and commissioned a fleet of speedy transport starships suited for exploration and small-scale colonization.  
  
Inspired by an ancient kasathan design, a Peregrinasi has a sleek exterior that sports sweeping fins for in-atmosphere flight, plus a rounded belly designed for water landings and concealed landing gear for terrestrial touchdowns. The starship’s interior combines clean curves and spacious living quarters, plus numerous common areas and amenities to maintain crew morale during long journeys. Those journeys have become shorter and shorter as kasathan designers have incorporated ever-better Drift engines into their designs. Older Peregrinasi models often used a mere Drift Basic engine and instead invested their limited resources into stronger shields to weather the myriad threats of the Vast.  
  
The Peregrinasi’s far-flung travels have endeared it to many travelers, and since 297 ag, Idari Crucible Works has sold the starships to non-kasatha explorers and merchants. With ample defensive features and specialized expansion bays, the Peregrinasi is also the favored vessel for any young kasathas embarking on their Tempering journeys. Most kasathan crews keep a position open to accommodate one of these adolescents, ensuring a smooth transmission of kasathan culture, wisdom, and solidarity from adults to youths. Those kasathan youths who are part of a tight-knit cohort might even secure a Peregrinasi of their own; these crews often only have a few ranks in each skill, making them a lesser challenge for anyone callous enough to attack the young adults. But word travels fast, and such predators often draw swift retaliation.
