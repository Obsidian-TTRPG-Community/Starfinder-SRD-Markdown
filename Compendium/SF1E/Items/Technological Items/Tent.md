# Tent

### Description

A portaledge tent functions as a mobile hotelier, but can anchor to virtually any vertical wall or sheer surface. Setting up a portaledge tent typically takes 10 minutes. Once set up, this provides space for two people to rest comfortably and safely without risk of falling. It takes a DC 26 Strength check to pry a portaledge tent loose, or a DC 20 Survival check to remove it while anyone or anything with 2 or more bulk is still inside it.
