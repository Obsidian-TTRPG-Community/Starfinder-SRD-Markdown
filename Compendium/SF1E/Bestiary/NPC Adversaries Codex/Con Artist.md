# Con Artist

Throughout the galaxy charlatans run countless cons, scams, and tricks, from small scale to large, from harmless to downright dangerous. Although their methods, modes, and goals vary, charlatans are nearly always selfish, greedy, and unscrupulous. Occasionally, a charlatan uses their skills to entertain, inspire, and astound—or to rip off oppressors, villains, and faceless mega corporations—but they’re the exception, not the rule. The following charlatans represent a diverse array of con artists, scammers, and impostors.

**Practiced Liar (Ex)** When a con artist attempts a Bluff check to lie, they can spend 1 Resolve Point to make the DC of their Bluff check equal to 10 + the target’s total Sense Motive bonus, even if the target is suspicious of the con artist. The con artist also gains a +2 circumstance bonus on such a Bluff check.

## Description

Con artists are small-time scammers who bilk the gullible of credits by convincing them something false is true. The street corner psychic spins fortunes for credits, the down-on-their-luck billionaire needs a favor, and the lawyer requests banking information to transfer a distant relative’s inheritance. Most rely on fast talk, quick wits, and a well-told lie, but others excel in technological scams.
