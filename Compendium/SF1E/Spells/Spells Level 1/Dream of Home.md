## Description

Drawing on the magic of the kasathan Pillar of the Homeworld or similar homey memories, you overwhelm the target with pleasant visions and thoughts of their home, whatever that means to them. If the target fails the saving throw, they become fascinated for the duration. If the target saves, they're fascinated for 1 round instead.
