# POISONS

Poisons are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection special property, such as an [[Injection Glove]] or [[Needler Pistol]]. It’s also possible to add a dose of poison to a melee weapon that deals piercing or slashing [[Damage]], though this takes a standard action and requires the poison to be in a vial that’s already in hand.

# RADIATION

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 404_  
**Level** —; **Price** —  
**Type** poison (emanation (see below)); **Save** —  
**Track** Constitution; **Frequency** 1/round  
**Effect** Radiation is an emanation poison, meaning that a victim only needs to enter an area suffused with radiation to be affected by it. Radiation suffuses a spherical area of effect that can extend into solid objects. The closer one gets to the center of an area of radiation, the stronger the radiation effect becomes. Radiation entries list the maximum level of radiation in an area, as well as the radius out to which this radiation level applies. The radiation continues to suffuse each increment out to an equal length beyond that radius, its strength degraded by one level per increment. For example, a spherical area of high radiation with a radius of 20 feet creates a zone of medium radiation spanning 20 feet to 40 feet from the center in all directions, and a similar zone of low radiation spanning 40 to 60 feet from the center.

A creature that leaves an area suffused with radiation is essentially cured of the poison effect. Ending the source of radiation or successfully casting _[[Remove Radioactivity]]_ has the same effect. As usual for poison effects, an affected creature requires rest to recover from radiation poisoning. _[[Remove Affliction]]_ doesn't cure a creature of the effects of radiation poisoning, but _[[Remove Radioactivity]]_ does.

At each state of impaired and beyond, the victim must succeed at a DC 18 Fortitude saving throw or contract the radiation sickness disease
