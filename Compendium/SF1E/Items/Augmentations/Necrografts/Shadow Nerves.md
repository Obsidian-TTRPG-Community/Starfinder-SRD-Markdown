# Shadow Nerves

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 96_  

**System**:: Spinal Column  
Shadow nerves are long strands of partially incorporeal undead nerve fibers that have strong connections to the Shadow Plane, allowing you to navigate a path that exists partially in the Material Plane and partially in the Shadow Plane. A number of times per day equal to the necrograft’s mark, you can take a guarded step of 10 feet, rather than the usual 5-foot guarded step, as long as you are not in an area of bright light.
