# MECH LOWER LIMBS
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 101_  
A mech's lower limbs typically take the form of legs, though hover pads and tank treads are common alternatives. A mech is limited to a single set of lower limbs. Lower limbs modify a variety of the mech's statistics and might grant additional movement options or provide additional uses for Power Points.
