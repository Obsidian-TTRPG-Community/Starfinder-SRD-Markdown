Hellknights of the Order of the Chain favor these lengths of blackened, fiery chain, which often incorporate etchings of infernal runes or hellscapes into their complex designs. Burning chains aren’t known for their damage so much as their extreme flexibility in confounding an enemy—and, of course, for the visual imagery a burning chain provides when combined with the distinctive Hellknight armor. The order’s names for the various models have become the most commonly used, from fiend-class burning chains to malebranche- and archdevil-class burning chains.

# FLAME WEAPONS

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
