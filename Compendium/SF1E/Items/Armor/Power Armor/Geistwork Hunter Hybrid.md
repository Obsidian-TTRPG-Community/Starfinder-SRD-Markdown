Marketed as a dueling frame by its Apostae-based manufacturer, Geistwork, this armor is far more suitable for performing perilous assassinations. A Geistwork hunter can use its weapon slots to mount both melee and ranged weapons, and it’s equipped with a proprietary drow stealth system that functions as a grandchild’s cloak that doesn’t occupy an upgrade slot. By spending an additional 110000 credits, the stealth system can be upgraded to function as a greater grandchild’s cloak instead.
