# Efficient Bandolier

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 226_  
**Level**:: 4
**Price**::  2000 
**Bulk**:: L

### Description

This bandolier fits over any Medium creature and contains five compartments, each corresponding to a specific type of weapon: melee weapons, small arms, longarms, heavy weapons, and explosives. Each compartment contains an extradimensional space designed to house up to 1 bulk of ammunition or batteries (for this purpose, 10 batteries or pieces of ammunition with no bulk count as having light bulk). The bandolier does not accumulate bulk even as its compartments are filled.  
  
Each _efficient bandolier_ includes an advanced AI capable of controlling the bandolier’s robotic components to suit your needs. As a swift action, you can command an _efficient bandolier_ to draw up to 1 bulk worth of batteries or ammunition, placing the items directly into one of your hands.
