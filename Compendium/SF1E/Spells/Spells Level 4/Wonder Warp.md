## Description

You alter the magical forces in the area near you into an unpredictable field of eldritch entropy, potentially causing a number of effects both positive and negatives for those who find themselves in the area.  
When you cast this spell, and each time you start your turn during the duration of the spell, roll d% on the following table. Each time there’s a new effect, you can attempt a Will saving throw. If you succeed, you can choose the targets affected by the warped magic. Otherwise, the effect affects all creatures (and sometimes objects) in the area, including you, as described. If the effect is a spell, the spell’s normal parameters (including saves to avoid its effects) apply, except for duration.  
Each effect lasts only until you roll again, or for the duration specified in the effect, whichever is shorter (except on a result of 100; in which case you use the spell’s normal duration). Subject to the GM’s discretion, in a low-magic area, you might have to subtract 10 from your d% rolls for this spell; in a highmagic area, you might have to add 10 instead.

<table><tbody><tr><td>D%</td><td>Effect</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>All magic ceases working, including for you, even if you succeed at the spell’s Will save. Unless you expend a 2nd-level spell slot at the start of your next turn, this spell ends.</td></tr><tr><td>2–5</td><td>Decrease the area, damage, duration, and range of spells and spell-like abilities used by half. If you failed the spell’s Will save, that includes the duration of this spell.</td></tr><tr><td>6–10</td><td>No effect.</td></tr><tr><td>11–14</td><td>Creatures are affected by the lesser confusion spell.</td></tr><tr><td>15–18</td><td>Creatures become vulnerable to one energy type; roll a d10 to determine which: on a 1–2, use acid; on a 3–4, use cold; on a 5–6, use electricity; on a 7–8, use fire; on a 9–10, use sonic. If you succeed at the spell’s Will save, you can choose the type for each target instead.</td></tr><tr><td>19–22</td><td>A Medium aeon arrives, as if summoned by a 3rd-level summon creature (Alien Archive 144 ) spell, and it’s hostile to you. Its turn occurs just after yours. If you succeed at the spell’s Will save, the aeon remains when the spell’s effect changes.</td></tr><tr><td>23–26</td><td>Dreamlike realities appear, customized to each creature; each creature who fails a Will save becomes fascinated.</td></tr><tr><td>27–30</td><td>Creatures must attempt a Fortitude save; on a failure, a random technological item they have ceases to function. A technological construct that fails is instead staggered.</td></tr><tr><td>31–34</td><td>You can read the surface thoughts of creatures in the area as if they were affected by the third round of the detect thoughts spell.</td></tr><tr><td>35–38</td><td>The area becomes zero gravity (Core Rulebook 402).</td></tr><tr><td>39–42</td><td>Creatures are affected by a 1st-level baleful polymorph (Alien Archive 2 147) spell.</td></tr><tr><td>43–46</td><td>Creatures are affected by the grease spell.</td></tr><tr><td>47–50</td><td>Each creature is affected by the force blast spell; you can attempt the additional bull rush combat maneuver granted by the spell.</td></tr><tr><td>51–54</td><td>Countless Diminutive creatures appear flying in the air and scrambling on the ground, making the area difficult terrain. To move at more than half speed in the area, a creature must succeed at a DC 15 Acrobatics check.</td></tr><tr><td>55–58</td><td>Chaotic illusions render creatures dazzled.</td></tr><tr><td>59–62</td><td>Creatures and objects become invisible.</td></tr><tr><td>63–66</td><td>Each creature switches positions with another randomly determined creature (no save). No creature arrives in a place immediately hazardous to it, instead appearing in the closest safe space.</td></tr><tr><td>67–70</td><td>Creatures gain a fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability. If a creature is airborne when the effect ends, it falls.</td></tr><tr><td>71–74</td><td>A random Medium creature arrives, as if summoned by a 3rd-level summon creature (Alien Archive 144 ) spell. If you succeed at wonder warp’s Will save, the creature acts as if you summoned it. Otherwise, it’s hostile to everyone.</td></tr><tr><td>75–78</td><td>Creatures gain resistance 5 to one energy type; roll a d10 to determine which: on a 1–2, use acid; on a 3–4, use cold; on a 5–6, use electricity; on a 7–8, use fire; on a 9–10, use sonic. If you succeed at the spell’s Will save, you can choose the type for each target instead.</td></tr><tr><td>79–82</td><td>Each creature regains 2d4 Hit Points or Stamina Points (creature’s choice).</td></tr><tr><td>83–86</td><td>You cast magic missile without expending a spell slot. If you take (and have taken) no other actions this turn, you can fire a third missile.</td></tr><tr><td>87–90</td><td>You create one effect of the prescience (Character Operations Manual 139 ) spell.</td></tr><tr><td>91–95</td><td>Increase the area, damage, duration, and range of spells and spell-like abilities used by 50%. That doesn’t include the duration of this spell.</td></tr><tr><td>96–99</td><td>Roll two effects, treating 1 and 96–100 as no effect. Each effect affects only targets of your choice.</td></tr><tr><td>100</td><td>You can cast any 1st- or 2nd-level spell you know without expending a spell slot. You must abide by the spell’s normal parameters, and it lasts for its normal duration.</td></tr></tbody></table>
