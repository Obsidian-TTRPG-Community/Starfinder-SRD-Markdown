# Drugs

Though numerous pharmaceuticals and similar substances can be referred to as drugs, this entry refers specifically to narcotics that are not typically used for medicinal purposes. Drugs are normally weaponized by loading a single dose into a weapon with the injection weapon property, such as an [[Injection Glove]] or [[Needler Pistol]]. Drugs can also be slipped into the food or drink of a target, normally requiring both that a character succeed at a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check and that the imbiber fail a separate DC 20 Perception check to notice the change in the drugged food or drink. For more information about drugs, including stat blocks for specific drugs and details about addiction and their other effects, see [[Afflictions]] on page 414.
