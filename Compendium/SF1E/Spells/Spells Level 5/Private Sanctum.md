## Description

This spell ensures privacy. Anyone looking into the area from outside sees only a dark, foggy mass. Darkvision cannot penetrate it. No sounds, no matter how loud, can escape the area, so nobody can eavesdrop from outside. Those inside can see out normally.

Divination (scrying) spells can’t perceive anything within the area, and those within are immune to _detect thoughts_. The ward prevents speech between those inside and those outside (because it blocks sound), and technological communication (as it blocks broadcasts), but it doesn’t prevent other magic communication, such as a _telepathic message_ spell, or telepathic communication.

The spell does not prevent creatures or objects from moving into and out of the area.
