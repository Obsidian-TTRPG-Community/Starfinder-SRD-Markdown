# Bounty Hunter

Anyone who seeks and catches those who don’t want to be caught may be called a bounty hunter, though in practice, the term comprises an array of professionals. Most bounty hunters have legal sanction, such as a license to hunt fugitives, but many also work in a gray area between legal authority and vigilantism. Bounty hunters take jobs from legitimate authorities, but what legitimate means varies by location. Little stops a bounty hunter from acting as an agent of a private party, and many are enforcers for the unscrupulous. Some clever bounty hunters double as private investigators, tracking down missing people or runaways.

### Special Abilities

**Mark (Ex)** A bounty hunter can choose one sapient creature as a mark, provided the bounty hunter can identify that creature by a specific identity and has studied the mark for 1 hour using available information, or directly observed the mark for 1 minute outside of combat or as a full action in combat. The bounty hunter gains an insight bonus on skill checks made to investigate, track, or gather information on the mark, as well as on Sense Motive checks against the mark. This bonus equals 1 + the bounty hunter’s CR divided by 6 (+2 total at CR 10). Also, the bounty hunter can use Sense Motive instead of Perception to use the pierce disguise or search tasks of the Perception skill against the mark.  
**Swift Stalker (Ex)** A bounty hunter reduces the penalty for following tracks using Survival while moving at full speed to 0. The agent also reduces the penalty for moving at more than half speed while using Stealth to hide to –5.

## Description

The bounty hunters of the public imagination are hardened experts who use combat, investigation, and legal knowhow to track fugitives across the stars. Such bounty hunters can be military or law enforcement personnel who hang up official duties for freelance ones. Others arose as civilian contractors, learning the rougher parts of the trade as they went. Whatever the case, these bounty hunters take on riskier contracts and don’t shy from jobs that might require hurting or killing the mark.
