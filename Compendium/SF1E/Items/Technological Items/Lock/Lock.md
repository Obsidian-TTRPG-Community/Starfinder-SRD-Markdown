# Lock

Locks are extremely advanced reusable devices, able to secure any fastening or closure by bonding with its surface and then holding fast. Locks usually open with a code, security chip, or voice command. Successful Engineering checks can disable locks. Locks come in four levels of quality—simple, average, good, and superior—which determine the DC of Engineering checks to open them without the proper key or code. A lock takes two hands to secure or open with a security chip. For more information on locks, including the Engineering DCs to open them, see the Engineering skill on page 141.
