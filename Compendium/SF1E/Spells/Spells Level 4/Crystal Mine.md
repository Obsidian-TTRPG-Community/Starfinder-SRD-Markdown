## Description

You create three electrified crystal proximity mines under the ground within range. Each mine must be within 30 feet of at least one of the other mines. Each mine occupies one 5-foot square and remains for the duration or until triggered. When a creature enters a space adjacent to a mine, that mine immediately explodes, dealing 2d8 piercing damage and 2d8 electricity damage to creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst centered on the mine. A creature can spot and disable a crystal mine as a trap with successful Perception and Engineering checks respectfully (DC = 15 + your caster level + your key ability score modifier).
