## DESCRIPTION

You rapidly conjure and assemble the components to make a grenade, which you throw as part of the action used to cast this spell, requiring an attack roll to hit the intersection as normal. The grenade has a 20-foot range increment, deals 1d4 piercing damage, and has the explode (5 feet) property. Creatures in the affected area can attempt a Reflex save to halve the damage.
