A dose of _adaptive serum_ consists of a small piece of ksarik flesh (usually the tip of one of its tentacles) floating in a slightly alcoholic tincture. For an hour after you consume an _adaptive serum_, the first time you take energy damage, you gain resistance against that type of damage for that attack and for the remainder of the hour or until you rest 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, whichever comes first. The amount of energy resistance you receive depends on the level of the serum. A _mk 1 adaptive serum_ grants energy resistance 5, a _mk 2 adaptive serum_ grants energy resistance 10, and a _mk 3 adaptive serum_ grants energy resistance 15.
