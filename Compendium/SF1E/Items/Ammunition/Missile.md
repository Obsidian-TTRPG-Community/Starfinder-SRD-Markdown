# Missile

Missiles are heavy, snub-nosed munitions with devastating explosive power. A missile’s damage when fired from a missile launcher (such as an IMDS missile launcher) is listed in its entry in Table 7–9: Ammunition on page 179.

### Special Weapons

Special weapons resist classification into any other category. Some adventurers favor special weapons for the abilities they offer or for their unique beauty.
