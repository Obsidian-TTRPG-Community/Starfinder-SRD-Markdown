## DESCRIPTION

A Void-Eater starship is a magnificent sight to behold: an enormous “space whale” traversing the galaxy with passengers in tow. But while most oma starships are built from the carcasses of recently deceased omas, the barathu-operated Star-Nambulance Inc. has a completely different approach. The company takes its name from the sleep-like stellar drifting of the mighty omas that its members so admire. Rather than exploit omas or use their dying corpses to build their Void-Eaters, the barathus of Star-Nambulance gently call to omas using a starsong beacon that exudes telepathic songs similar to the ones the creatures naturally emit themselves. Star-Nambulance trainers gradually build trust with these omas until they earn the right to ride them through space.  
  
Once the omas accept passengers, Star-Nambulance gradually begins building structures on the oma, making a living starship that can take passengers across the galaxy. They sell these ships as Void-Eaters, an ethical alternative to oma carcass ships. These ships are high-end luxury goods, with Star-Nambulance only able to produce two or three a year. As a result, many barathus think of oma ships as the pinnacle of space travel, and the waiting list is for these living versions is decades long. Pilots must get accustomed to an entirely different method of piloting, as steering relies on simulated starsongs to move the oma in a particular direction.  
  
The oma’s natural electrical field powers a series of laser weapons, but these living starships are not intended for battle. In fact, Star-Nambulance specifies that if a Void-Eater is deliberately taken into a fight, the company can repossess it. The interior is designed with luxury in mind, though non-barathus find the accommodations somewhat odd, as personal quarters and bridge stations designed around barathu anatomy don’t work for anyone else. Star-Nambulance has yet to create a Void-Eater for a non-barathu buyer, though there are several on the wait-list.  

## SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Drift Resistant (Ex)** An oma’s body must be specially refitted to accommodate Drift travel; installing a Drift engine in an oma increases the price of the engine by 50%.
