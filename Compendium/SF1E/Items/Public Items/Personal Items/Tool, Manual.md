### Description

Manual tools are extremely varied, but mass production has rendered the price and statistics of these items virtually identical. Sample manual tools include crowbars, hammers, mining picks, rakes, saws, shovels, sledgehammers, and similar implements. Using a manual tool for a job relevant to that tool grants you a +1 circumstance bonus to all ability checks and skill checks related to that job.
