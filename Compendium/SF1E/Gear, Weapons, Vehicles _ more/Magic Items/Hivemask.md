### DESCRIPTION

As a move action when wearing a _hivemask_, you can learn the location of each other worn _hivemask_ within 100 feet and can use your vision to see through any one of those masks. You can see through another mask for as long as you’d like, but you must take a move action each round to do so. While extending your vision to another _hivemask_, you are blinded and flat-footed.
