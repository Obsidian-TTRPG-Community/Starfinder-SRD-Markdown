This adrenaline-filled injection provides you with a burst of energy, allowing you to shrug off the effects of fatigue or exhaustion for a short time, though this surge takes a toll on you. A tier 1 stimulant lasts for 1d4 rounds, a tier 2 stimulant lasts for 2d4 rounds, a tier 3 stimulant lasts for 4d4 rounds, and a tier 4 stimulant lasts for 6d4 rounds, during which time you can ignore all penalties due to being fatigued or exhausted. After the stimulant wears off, the condition returns, but if you would have been fatigued, you are instead exhausted.
