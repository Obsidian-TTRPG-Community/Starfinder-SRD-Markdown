# Predator, Gargantuan Predator

From the vortex sharks of Kalo-Mahoi to the hoarbats of Verces’s Darkside, and from the dire tigers of Castrovel to the tremor worms of Akiton, predators abound in the Pact Worlds and on planets across the galaxy. What unites these disparate species is that their diets include the meat of other creatures and that they hunt and kill to acquire this food. On planets where sapient species are dominant, predators have learned that weapon-wielding creatures can be deadly prey. Other predators, deprived of such contact, often see sentient explorers as an unfamiliar form of potential sustenance, making confrontations inevitable.

Predators come in all shapes and sizes, limited only by the environment where they are found. Bigger predators rely on abundant food, cycles of inactivity, an omnivorous diet, or a combination of these. Smaller predators have fewer requirements and can be equally dangerous; even very small animals can evolve pack tactics to overwhelm larger and stronger creatures. Some of these swarms, such as the flying viper eels of Bretheda, strip flesh from bone as they move over and around prey.
