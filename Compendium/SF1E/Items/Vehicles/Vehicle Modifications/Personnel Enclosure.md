# Personnel Enclosure

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 82_
**Price**:: 750  
Additional wall panels or personal shielding protects the vehicle’s passengers. The vehicle gives its pilot and passengers partial cover. If the vehicle already grants partial cover, it instead grants its pilot and passengers cover. This modification grants no benefit to a vehicle that already grants its passengers cover, improved cover, or total cover.
