SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### EXPERIMENTAL HEALING (SU)

An apothecary’s knowledge of experimental medicine extends to esoteric draughts that can enhance lifelink at great personal risk to the apothecary. When using lifelink, they can choose to enhance it, to instead transfer 4d8 Hit Points. This renders the apothecary staggered for 1d3 rounds the first time the apothecary uses it on any given day. The second time, the apothecary is rendered unconscious for 1 hour instead. The apothecary may use this ability 2 times before requiring an 8-hour rest to use it again.

#### HEALING CHANNEL (SU)

An apothecary can channel energy to heal themselves and their allies. Healing themselves with this channeled energy is a move action, healing an ally touched is a standard action, and healing all allies within 30 feet is a full action. This energy heals 4d8 Hit Points. The apothecary may use this ability 2 times before requiring an 8-hour rest to use it again.

#### HOBBLED (EX)

The apothecary suffers from an incurable genetic defect or an incurable combat injury in their legs, which reduces their speed.

#### LIFELINK (SU)

At the start of each turn, an apothecary can choose an ally within 30 feet who has taken Hit Point damage and transfer the wounds to themselves, dealing up to 4 Hit Points damage to themselves, while healing the ally’s Hit Points by an equal amount. This does not require any action. Damage thus incurred may not be prevented or reduced by any means.

ABOUT

Apothecaries are wise healers, often scarred by the harsh life in space. Their injuries (of which being hobbled is but one example) drive them to ceaselessly explore experimental medicines, both magical and mundane.
