Benefit: As a full action, you can move up to your speed and make a single melee attack or combat maneuver without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack. You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack, and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn. If you have the trick attack class feature, you can take your movement from trick attack at any time during a trick attack with a melee weapon (instead of only before), without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack.
Prerequisites: Dex 15, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.

# Spring Attack (COMBAT)

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 162_  
You can deftly move up to a foe, strike, and withdraw before it can react.

**Prerequisites**: Dex 15, Mobility, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit**: As a full action, you can move up to your speed and make a single melee attack or combat maneuver without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack. You can move both before and after the attack, but you must move at least 10 feet before the attack, and the total distance that you move cannot be greater than your speed. You cannot use this ability to attack a foe that is adjacent to you at the start of your turn. If you have the trick attack class feature, you can take your movement from trick attack at any time during a trick attack with a melee weapon (instead of only before), without provoking any attacks of opportunity from the target of your attack.

**Normal**: You can move only before or after an attack, not both.
