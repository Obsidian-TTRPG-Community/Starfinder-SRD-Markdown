## Description

You detect the presence of augmentations installed within creatures you can see within the area, which appear to you as glowing outlines around the systems in which the augmentations are installed. The spell allows you to determine the type of augmentation, such as biotech, cybernetic, magitech, or necrotech, and its item level, but it does not reveal the function of the augmentation. This spell does not reveal hidden or invisible creatures.
