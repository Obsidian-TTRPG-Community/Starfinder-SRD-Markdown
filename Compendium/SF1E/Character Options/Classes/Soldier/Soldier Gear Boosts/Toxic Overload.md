name:: Toxic Overload 
type:: Ex
level:: 7th 
source:: Starfinder Enhanced pg. 75
desc:: When you hit with a weapon in the shock category, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to overload the environmental protections built into the target’s armor, flooding their armor with dangerous gases. Choose one of these three effects (Fortitude negates):
Caustic gases irritate the target’s eyes, causing them to treat all creatures as though they have concealment.
Toxic fumes give the creature the sickened condition.
Hallucinogenic fumes give the creature the shaken condition.
The malfunction and effects last for 1d4 rounds, though a creature can end the effects immediately by deactivating their environmental protections as a standard action. Once you affect a creature with this gear boost, they are immune to it for 24 hours. This has no effect on creatures who aren’t wearing armor that provides environmental protections.
