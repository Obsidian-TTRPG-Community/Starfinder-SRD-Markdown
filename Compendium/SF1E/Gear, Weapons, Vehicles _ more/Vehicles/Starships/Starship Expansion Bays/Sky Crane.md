## SKY CRANE

**Source** _Ports of Call pg. 29_  
**PCU** 10; **Cost (in BP)** 5  
A sky crane uses massive parachutes and thrusters to transport terrestrial vehicles and mechs from a starship in orbit or the atmosphere to the ground and back again. The sky crane requires two expansion bays on its own as well as appropriate storage, such as a mech bay (page 28), and can deploy or recover one mech or vehicle per hour.
