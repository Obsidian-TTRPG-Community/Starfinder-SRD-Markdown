# JETPACK
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 205_  
**Item Level** 5; **Price** 3,100  
**Slots** 1; **Armor Type** Light, Heavy; **Bulk** 1  
**Capacity** 40; **Usage** 2/round  
You gain a fly speed of 30 feet (average maneuverability). You can use this for “cruising flight” at a usage of only 1 charge per minute, but you are flat-footed and off-target while doing so. Changing from normal flight to cruising flight or vice versa is a standard action. A jetpack can’t lift you if you’re encumbered.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in light or heavy armor.
