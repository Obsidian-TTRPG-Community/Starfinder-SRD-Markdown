ABOUT

An alien hunter is a clever, experienced hunter, prowling the forest trails with her faithful hawk serving as her eyes above. Whether seeking a reward or bounty, an impressive trophy, or simply an epic fireside tale of the hunt, an alien hunter seldom rests or tarries long when she hears whispered tales of wild things to put in her sights. Monster hunters can be outriders and protectors of the wilderness or skilled hunters. Different types of monster hunters can be easily created by changing the monster hunter’s favored enemy, favored terrain, or animal companion, or adding a mount and exchanging some ranged combat feats for mounted combat feats.
