You do not learn the location of or direction to these conditions, only their presence. However, after concentrating for a time, you can learn the following additional information.

**1 Minute:** Forecast the weather for the next 48 hours, including the direction it will come from.

**5 Minutes:** Learn which atmospheres, biomes, and gravity are in the area, if they vary, as well as the direction and distance to those elements.
