# Grip

Weapons can be fitted with special grips that provide various advantages. You can combine grips by paying the combined price of the grips, but only if all grips are integrated into a weapon. Their benefits stack. The benefits of a grip depend on its type.  

## Grip, Blur (HYBRID)

### Description

A _blur grip_ consists of microcircuitry embedded inside the padded grip of a melee weapon. Five times per day as a move action, you can squeeze the grip to activate it, creating an illusion that makes it hard to visually track the weapon. Until the end of your next turn, the _blur grip_ grants you a +4 circumstance bonus to Bluff checks to feint.

### Description

Only small arms can have a folding grip, and it must be integrated with the weapon. As a move action, you can fold or unfold a folding grip, granting you a +2 circumstance bonus to Sleight of Hand checks to hide the small arm on your person.

### Description

A nanofiber grip strengthens your hold on a weapon. While you wield the weapon, microscopic fibers act as setae, clinging to your hands. These fibers grant you a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against disarm combat maneuvers that would disarm you of the weapon.

## Grip, Null-space (HYBRID)

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 60_  
**Level** 6;

### Description

A _null-space grip_ must be integrated into a melee weapon or small arm. As a move action, you can activate the grip to pull the weapon into an extradimensional space, leaving only a disk 1-1/2 inches in diameter. This disk is easy to hide on your person, granting you a +4 circumstance bonus to your Sleight of Hand check to do so. Additionally, the disk might not be recognized as a weapon without Engineering or Mysticism and _detect magic_ used together to identify the item. As a move action, you can squeeze the disk to return the weapon to normal form.
