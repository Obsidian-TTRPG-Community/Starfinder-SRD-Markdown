Common textiles include good linen and most synthetic fabrics. Fine textiles are of higher quality, with more visual appeal, higher durability, or both. Various silks, satins, and similar cloths are typical fine textiles, though more exotic materials exist in this category. Truly luxurious fabrics, including marramas and samite, can easily cost much more than even the best fine fabrics.
