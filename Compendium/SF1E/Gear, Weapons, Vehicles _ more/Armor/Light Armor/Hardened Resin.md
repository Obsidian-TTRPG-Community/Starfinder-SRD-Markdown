### DESCRIPTION

Many insectile haans of Bretheda shun all but the simplest tools, but some skilled armorsmiths among them incorporate pieces of their own molted exoskeletons into simple protective shells. While the armor usually built to fit Large creatures, suits designed for smaller wearers can sometimes be found.
