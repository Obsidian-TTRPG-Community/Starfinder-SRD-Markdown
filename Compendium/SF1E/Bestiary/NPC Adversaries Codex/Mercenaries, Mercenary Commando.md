# Mercenaries, Mercenary Commando

Mercenaries work for the highest bidder, generally with no questions asked (except by those who belong to the Skyfire Legion and a few other more principled companies). Mercenaries can serve the interests of almost any faction with enough credits, but most often they work for employers who can't employ a formal military force or who can't be seen getting their own hands dirty. Since their ultimate goal is simply to get paid, mercenaries are rarely willing to fight to the death unless they fear failure will ruin them completely anyway. If approached with an appealing offer, some particularly ruthless mercenaries are willing to betray their employers, but their new loyalty is just as fickle. Many mercenaries know that changing sides in the middle of a job could ruin their reputations, so they are therefore willing to be bought off only in a way that they can plausibly deny later or that will make them so much money that they will be set for life. There are countless mercenary groups throughout the Pact Worlds, ranging from large and acclaimed to small and obscure. Many groups specialize in certain types of missions; some take on only jobs that put them on the battlefield, while others prefer to stick to the shadows. Mercenary groups accept a variety of forms of payment, from hard credits to technological gear and weapons to magic items.

## Description

A mercenary commando is the best there is at quickly and quietly eliminating enemies and hazards for an employer, preferably leaving little or no collateral damage, evidence, or witnesses. Some lead teams of rookie mercenaries, but many operate alone or in small strike teams against well-researched targets. Teams that operate with commandos often demand high prices.  
Commandos prefer to go in knowing all the angles, but they are very good at improvising when that simply isn't an option. Those who pride themselves on cold professionalism speak only to further their latest ploy, but the most storied commandos are those who take pleasure in playful banter with challenging foes, especially ones who survive to face them again another time.  
**Adaptation:** A mercenary commando can be an assassin serving Lao Shu Po or a master Steward spy working a mission that cannot be officially acknowledged.
