# Mobility Enhancer

This system of elastic braces and joint support structures reduces the stress heavy armor exerts on your body, allowing you to move faster despite the armor’s bulk. A mobility enhancer reduces the armor’s speed adjustment by an amount determined by the upgrade’s type, as listed below. The speed adjustment of the armor can’t increase above 0 feet. 

-   **Mk 1 (Level 3)**: Reduce the armor’s speed adjustment by 5 feet. 
-   **Mk 2 (Level 8)**: Reduce the armor’s speed adjustment by 10 feet.

This upgrade can be installed only in heavy armor.
