# Distracting Dose

source: Starfinder Enhanced pg. 75
You exploit an envenomed foeâ€™s distress to disappear. When you use a weapon with the injection weapon special property to deliver a poison or drug, and the target fails their initial saving throw against the toxin, you can attempt a Bluff check to create a diversion as a swift action before the end of your turn. When creating a diversion in this way, you can use your Medicine skill modifier in place of your Bluff modifier.
