The coloration of the vehicle’s exterior automatically changes to match its surroundings. Its pilot can attempt Stealth checks for the vehicle as long as it is stationary, but with a –4 penalty. This check is opposed by creatures’ Perception checks, or Computers checks for those scanning the area with sensors.
