# DAZZLER
Dazzlers are a form of crowd control used primarily for civil peacekeeping. While the weapons use lasers to damage and sometimes blind targets, the beams are carefully calibrated to avoid inflicting lethal injury. Built on similar principles to the smaller compliance ray, dazzlers also tend to bear the colors of local law-enforcement groups. However, the similarities end there, as the dazzler is a bulky device usually carried with the help of a shoulder strap, with its business end covered by dozens of glassy bulbs surrounded by a conical shield. Downplaying this somewhat disturbing appearance, dazzler manufacturer ATech holds up the weapons as an important tool for safe peacekeeping and spreads the weapons wherever AbadarCorp is found. Dazzlers come in flash, strobe, and sunspot models.

### LASER WEAPONS

Laser weapons emit highly focused beams of light that deal fire damage. These beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.

Laser weapons use various means to concentrate beams of light into deadly intensity. Some focus light through a faceted crystal, while others focus the beam through a chemical cloud or ionized gas.
