Effect: The kaleidoscopic fusion augments a weapon’s attacks, causing them to appear unusually bright, colorful, and even mesmerizing. The weapon gains the kaleidoscopic charm critical hit effect. When this critical hit effect is triggered, the fusion converts the weapon’s force into a powerful enchantment. The target takes no damage from the attack and instead is charmed for 1d4 rounds, as though you had cast charm monster on it (Will save negates). If the target is immune to this effect or negates it with a successful saving throw, the target takes the double damage as normal. When you score a critical hit with a weapon that has multiple critical hit effects, you can apply only one of those effects of your choice. This fusion can only be applied to weapons that deal electricity or fire damage, or that have the aurora, bright, or fiery AR weapon special properties.
