# Charged Skin

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 90_  
**Level**:: 5
**Price**::  3075 
**System**:: Skin  
Your skin slowly generates electricity that can be used to power devices that require power measured in charges from a battery to function, such as a powered weapon. You must be touching the item to use it. Your charged skin holds 10 such charges, which are replenished each day after a full night’s rest. You can’t charge a battery or item with your charged skin; you can spend charges directly from it only to power held devices.
