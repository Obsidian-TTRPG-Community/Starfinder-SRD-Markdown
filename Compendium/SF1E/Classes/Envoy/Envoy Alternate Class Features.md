# ENVOY ALTERNATE CLASS FEATURES

## PSYCHIC EXPERTISE 
**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 20_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You have latent psychic powers you’ve honed through practice and willpower into impressive feats of supernatural ability.  
Psychic expertise alters expertise, and it replaces skill expertise and the expertise talent gained at 3rd level.  
  

## PSYCHIC COMMUNICATOR (SU) - 1ST LEVEL

You gain limited telepathy (Core Rulebook page 265). If you already have limited telepathy, you instead increase its range by 30 feet. At 9th level, you gain telepathy with a 30-foot range, allowing you to communicate mentally with any creature that has a language, even one you don’t share.  
  

## PSYCHIC RESILIENCE (SU) - 1ST LEVEL

You gain the envoy’s expertise ability, though you roll 1d4 for your expertise die. At 5th level, anytime you roll your expertise die, you gain a +1 bonus to the result. At 9th, 17th, and 20th levels, this bonus increases by 1. At 13th level, you roll 1d6 as your expertise die instead of 1d4. As a reaction before you attempt a Will save against a mind-affecting effect, you can roll your expertise die and add the result of the roll to your saving throw as an enhancement bonus. You must have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining to increase your saving throw in this way, and once you have done so, you cannot do so again until you have regained Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest.  
At 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter, choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Disguise, Intimidate, or Medicine. You are treated as having expertise with that skill for the purposes of expertise talents and other prerequisites, though you do not actually add your expertise die to any skill checks except Sense Motive.  
  

## MENTAL AWARENESS (SU) - 3RD LEVEL

At 3rd level, you gain blindsense (thought) with a range of 10 feet. This blindsense’s range increases to 20 feet at 9th level, 30 feet at 13th level, and 60 feet at 17th level.  
  

## PSYCHIC EXPLOITS (SP) - 5TH LEVEL

You can focus your mental powers to directly monitor or modify the thoughts of those around you. You can use your psychic exploits twice per day, though you regain one daily use each time you regain Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest. Your psychic exploits can detect or affect only creatures you can sense with your mental awareness. Any spell-like abilities use your envoy level as their caster level and your Charisma score to calculate saving throw DCs.  
At 5th level, you can expend a psychic exploit to cast detect thoughts, mental silence, or mindlink as a spell-like ability. At 9th level, you can expend a psychic exploit when activating your psychic resilience ability to apply the latter’s bonus to a Will saving throw to a number of allies equal to half your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). At 13th level, you can expend a psychic exploit and 2 Resolve Points to cast discern lies, mind probe, or modify memory as a spell-like ability. At 17th level, you can expend a psychic exploit to gain blindsight (thought) with a range of 60 feet for 10 minutes.

## SIGNATURE ITEM (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 20_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
One of your items is an indispensable part of your technique or persona. At 1st level, after purchasing your starting equipment, designate one piece of equipment as your signature item, and choose one of the following categories that best fits the item: armor, clothing, tool, or weapon. Your signature item provides benefits based on the item's category. You can use the benefits granted by your item as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining and the item is in your possession and not destroyed. These special benefits are an extension of your exceptional connection to the item, and they don't function for others who wield or wear the item. Once per week, if your item is lost or destroyed, you can replace it with another item of the same category by spending 8 hours practicing with the new item. Whenever you gain a level, you can replace your signature item with a different one by spending 24 hours acclimating yourself to the replacement. If your new item is of a different category, you replace all benefits granted by the previous item with those of the new category.  
You gain the benefits of your expertise class feature only while your signature gear is in your possession. You only add your expertise die to the skills you select with your skill expertise class feature; you don't automatically gain the ability to add your expertise die to Sense Motive checks. The first skill you select for skill expertise must be selected from a specific list based on your gear's category.  
This feature modifies expertise and replaces the envoy improvisation gained at 1st level.

##  SIGNATURE CLOTHING (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 20_  
Your signature item is a worn garment that doesn't provide an armor bonus, such as a hat or a complete outfit (Core Rulebook 230). When you gain your signature clothing, select two skills from the following to which you apply skill expertise: Bluff, Culture, Diplomacy, Disguise, or Intimidate. In addition, whenever you select an expertise talent associated with one of these skills, you also gain an expertise talent for the second skill. You can only use the skill expertise and expertise talents for one of these two skills at a time, but once per hour, as a standard action, you can adjust your signature clothing (such as by reversing your jacket or dramatically straightening your hat) to change which of the two skills' benefits you can use. You can use this ability an additional time per hour by spending 1 Resolve Point for each additional use. Once per day, before rolling your expertise die as part of a skill check for one of these skills, you can choose to roll your expertise die twice and take the better result.  
  
Additional skills you select with skill expertise function normally, as do the expertise talents you qualify for based on these additional skills.

---

## SIGNATURE TOOL (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 20_  
Your signature item is a handheld device with a specific non-combat purpose, such as a hacking kit or datapad. Your first skill expertise must be selected from the following list: Computers, Engineering, or Medicine. If you choose Computers or Engineering, your signature tool also functions as a mechanic's custom rig, and you can select mechanic tricks as though they were expertise talents, qualifying for tricks using the sum of your envoy and mechanic levels as your mechanic level. However, this doesn't grant you any other mechanic class features, and you can't select tricks that require another mechanic ability unless you've gained it from another source.  
  
If you choose Medicine, your signature tool also functions as a 1st-level biohacker's custom microlab, though if you have a custom microlab from another class, add your envoy levels and the other class's levels together for determining its abilities. You can select biohacker theorems as though they were expertise talents, qualifying for theorems using the sum of your envoy and biohacker levels as your biohacker level. However, this doesn't grant you any other biohacker abilities, and you can't select theorems that require another biohacker ability unless you've gained that required ability from another source.

---

##  SIGNATURE WEAPON (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 20_  
Your signature item is a weapon. You can't select a natural weapon, but you can select an item that modifies a particular type of attack, such as a solarian weapon crystal or an augmentation that enhances your unarmed strikes. Your first skill expertise must be selected from the following list: Bluff, Engineering, or Intimidate. As a move action during combat, you can designate a foe and openly flourish your weapon at them, gaining a brief burst of confidence and accuracy. For a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier, you can make attacks against the designated foe with your signature weapon as if your base attack bonus from your envoy levels were equal to your envoy level; you must be able to see the foe to gain this benefit to your attack.

---

##  SIGNTAURE ARMOR (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 20_  
Your signature item is a suit of armor, shield, or other gear specifically designed to protect you from harm. Your first skill expertise must be selected from the following: Disguise, Intimidate, or Sense Motive. Once per hour, as a reaction when an attack successfully hits you and deals damage, you can roll your expertise die and reduce the damage you take from the attack by an amount equal to your die's result plus your envoy level. You can use this ability an additional time per hour by spending 1 Resolve Point for each additional use.  
  
You ignore the base save bonus requirement of the saving expertise COM expertise talent. If you add your expertise die result to a save and the expertise die's result is a natural 1, you can reroll the expertise die once and use the second result.

## SPELL SPEAKER (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 20_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You’ve learned to speak with, encourage, and reprimand magical forces as if they were living beings. And, to your credit, magic listens. Through a combination of encouragements, you can coax magic to follow your instructions and overcome even difficult obstacles, enhancing your companions’ spellcasting.  
At 1st level, you can encourage the magic of an ally within 30 feet as a standard action, empowering the next 0-level or 1st-level spell they cast before the end of your next turn. The maximum level of spell that you can encourage increases by 1 for every 6 envoy levels you have, and you can increase this maximum level by 50% (rounded down) if you also spend 1 Resolve Point when using this ability. Once an ally has benefited from this encouragement, that ally can’t gain the benefits of your spell speaker ability again until they take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.  
An empowered spell gains one of the following benefits.  
**Amplified:** The spell is especially potent. On the turn that they cast the spell, the spellcaster can reroll any of the dice rolled to determine the spell’s effect (such as damage dice) whose result is a 1 and take the second result. Any such die that rolls its maximum value (such as 4 on a d4) treats its result as though it were 1 higher.  
**Extended:** The spell’s duration is increased by 50%.  
**Stretched:** The spell’s range is increased by 50%. If the range is touch, the spellcaster treats their natural reach as 5 feet greater for the purpose of delivering the spell.  
**Targeted:** The spell eagerly seeks its target. On the turn that they cast the spell, the spellcaster can roll one attack roll (and any roll to resolve miss chance from concealment for that attack) twice and use the better result.  
**Unstoppable:** The spell overcomes all obstacles. The spell treats any targets’ resistances as though they were reduced by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0). The spellcaster treats their caster level as 2 higher for the purpose of overcoming spell resistance.  
**Widened:** You increase the length of any line effect created by the spell by 50%. You increase the length of any cone effect created by the spell by 25% (minimum 5 feet). You increase the radius of any cylinder or burst effect created by the spell by 25%; this has no effect on spells that create a burst whose radius is less than 20 feet.  
This replaces the envoy improvisation gained at 1st level.

## TECH WHISPERER (EX)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 21_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You have an empathic connection to technological devices. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature. Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Computers, Diplomacy, Engineering, or Intimidate. At 1st level, you can add your expertise die to skill checks using the chosen skill. At 6th level and every 5 levels thereafter, you can use expertise with one additional skill from the list.  
All of your mind-affecting envoy improvisations can affect constructs, robots, and other creatures that have the technological subtype, even if they’re mindless or normally immune to such effects. However, these creatures receive a +2 bonus to their Will saves against your mind‑affecting improvisations.  
At 5th level, you can communicate with technological machines (including non-sentient devices) in rudimentary ways as well as understand in vague terms the information they try to convey to you; this information usually consists of simple terms, such as “no entry” or “need energy,” or basic operating prompts, like “speak name” or “need keycard and password.” This allows you to use Bluff, Diplomacy, or Intimidate in place of Engineering to identify technology, so long as you can communicate with it.  
At 9th level, you can attempt Diplomacy and Intimidate checks to influence such machines, though the DC of this check is 15 + 1-1/2 the device’s item level, further modified by the item’s initial attitude for Diplomacy checks. Most machines are indifferent, though some (particularly security systems) might be unfriendly or even hostile. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to affect friendly machines with Computers or Engineering checks, and the bonus increases to +4 for helpful machines. At the GM’s discretion, helpful devices might perform simple favors for you. By contrast, a device made hostile by you might activate countermeasures, such as setting off alarms.  
This isn’t a language-dependent or sense-dependent ability, but you must have physical contact with a machine that isn’t able to perceive you.  
This feature alters expertise and skill expertise.

## COMBAT EXPERTISE (EX)1ST LEVEL

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 68_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You’re able to use your social skills and abilities to gain the upper hand during a confrontation, often depending on deception, misdirection, and pure confidence to defeat your foes instead of brute force. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature, but you do not add it to skill checks. Choose one of the following skills: Bluff, Computers, Culture, Diplomacy, Intimidate, or Sense Motive.  
  
As a standard action, you can make an expertise attack as an attack action. Prior to your attack roll, attempt a skill check using the chosen skill with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × your target’s CR. If you succeed at the check and your attack hits, you roll your expertise die and add the result to your damage roll, and the target is shaken for 1 round.  
  
You can use this ability and other expertise abilities as long as you have at least 1 Resolve Point remaining. This ability counts as the expertise ability for purposes of other abilities and prerequisites. If an ability requires you to forgo your expertise die on a skill check to gain some other benefit (such as altered bearing), you can use that ability only in a round in which you did not use combat expertise.  
  
At 5th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you can select another skill you can use with combat expertise. This counts as having expertise with that skill for purposes of expertise talents and other prerequisites, though you do not actually add your expertise die to any skill checks.  
  
This replaces expertise and skill expertise.

## MAGICAL EXPERTISE (EX)1ST LEVEL

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 68_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You’re a master of Mysticism and exceptionally skilled at identifying and wielding magic. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature. You add Mysticism to your list of class skills, and you add your expertise die to your Mysticism check results instead of your Sense Motive check results.  
  
You also gain the following limited version of the mystic’s spells class feature. You use your Charisma score in place of your Wisdom score when determining the effects of your spellcasting, including the highest level of spell you can cast and the Difficulty Class for saving throws against your spells. Unlike a mystic, your selection of spells and spells per day is extremely limited. You begin play knowing one 0-level mystic spell, and you can cast your 0-level spells three times per day. At 5th level, you learn one 1st-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. At 9th level, you learn one 2nd-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. At 13th level, you learn one 3rd-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. At 17th level, you learn one 4th-level mystic spell and can cast it once per day. Otherwise, this ability functions as the mystic’s spells class feature, including the ability to decipher magical inscriptions. You can cast your lower-level spells known using your higher-level spell slots, and you can cast variable-level spells you know using any level of spell slot you have available.  
  
This ability counts as the expertise ability for the purposes of other abilities and prerequisites. If an ability requires you to forgo your expertise die on a skill check to gain some other benefit (such as altered bearing), you must expend one of the spell slots you gain from this ability to gain that benefit.  
  
In addition, whenever you would gain a new expertise talent, you can instead choose one spell level that is at least one spell level lower than the highest spell level you can cast using this ability. You learn one additional mystic spell of the chosen spell level and increase your spells per day for that spell level by one, to a maximum of four.  
  
This ability replaces expertise and skill expertise, and it alters expertise talents.# Motivation Expertise (Ex)1st Level

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 68_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You’re an expert at making people happy and high-spirited, allowing them to press forward when they might otherwise quit. You gain an expertise die of the same value as that granted to an envoy of your level by the expertise class feature. At 1st level, whenever you take an action that restores a creature’s Stamina Points or Hit Points, you can restore additional Stamina Points equal to the result of the roll of your expertise die. You can still use your expertise die on Sense Motive checks, but you always add the minimum possible result. This is also true for any skills you select with skill expertise.  
  
This replaces expertise.

## POLYMORPHIC DISGUISE (SU)1ST LEVEL

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 68_  
**Class** Envoy  
  
You’re an expert in secret arts that allow you to change your appearance into something—or someone—totally different. You gain the shapechanger subtype and the change shape universal monster rule (Starfinder Alien Archive 152). This ability has the polymorph descriptor (Starfinder Alien Archive 2 141), and you must design one polymorph form to use with this ability. You must comply with all restrictions imposed by a 1st-level polymorph spell when designing this form (Alien Archive 2 145), and you can’t design a form of a creature that has an Intelligence modifier of −3 or lower. You add your expertise die to Disguise checks to change your appearance to your chosen form.  
  
At 5th level, your shapeshifting abilities improve. When you design your form, you must comply with all restrictions imposed by a 2nd-level polymorph spell. This further improves to a 3rdlevel polymorph spell at 9th level, a 4th-level polymorph spell at 13th level, a 5th-level polymorph spell at 17th level, and a 6th-level polymorph spell at 20th level.  
  
When selecting expertise talents, you don’t need to have expertise in the skills they affect, and you can use any expertise talent that requires you to forgo your expertise die by spending 1 Resolve Point as part of the action to use the expertise talent. In addition, when you would gain an expertise talent, you can instead learn a new polymorph form that you can assume using this alternate class feature.  
  
This alters expertise talents and replaces expertise, skill expertise, and true expertise.
