desc:: When you make a ranged attack using a projectile weapon or other ranged weapon that uses physical ammunition 
(Such as darts or arrows) but fail to hit your target’s AC by an amount that does not exceed any AC bonus that creature receives against your attack due to cover, you can fire a second shot as a reaction to deflect your first attack midair toward the target. Roll 1d6, and reduce the target’s AC bonus from cover against your first attack by that amount (minimum +0), potentially causing your first attack to succeed retroactively
