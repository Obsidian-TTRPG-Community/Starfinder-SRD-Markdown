Benefit: When you successfully use Bluff to create a diversion, you can allow an ally that’s adjacent to a creature that you diverted to attempt a DC 20 Sleight of Hand check to pick that creature’s pocket. You can allow your ally to place an object of negligible or light bulk on that creature instead of stealing an object, but the ally takes a –5 penalty to their Sleight of Hand check.
