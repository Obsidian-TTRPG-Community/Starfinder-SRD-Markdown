# Equinoxian, Equinoxian Periastra

Equinoxians are rare and unusual native outsiders who simultaneously embody the power of both black holes and blazing suns. Alternating waves of photons and gravitons constantly travel along their roughly humanoid‑shaped bodies. An equinoxian’s head and legs might shine with light while its torso and arms remain as black as the void, and a few seconds later, the opposite may be true, as waves of energy ripple through the equinoxian’s body. As equinoxians age and their connection to the Cycle grows, they must learn to master the perfect balance of the contradictory powers within themselves, lest they lose control of those forces.

Equinoxian periastras are masters of the Cycle, perpetually balancing the gravitonic and photonic forces comprising their bodies, and they are legendary for their fighting prowess. They oppose forces of chaos and guard sites holy to solarians, allowing visitors to enter only after they have proven their mastery of the Cycle in combat.

Those equinoxians who cannot maintain balance are driven mad, becoming the tragic and powerful figures known as apastras. Apastras seek to cause imbalance and collapse wherever they can, and solarians justly fear the enraged creatures.

### Special Abilities

**Balanced Alignment (Su)** A periastra is always both photon attuned and graviton attuned (but not fully attuned). If subject to an effect that depends on the periastra’s stellar alignment, the periastra uses whichever attunement is most beneficial to it.

**Flashing Strikes (Ex)** This functions as the flashing strikes solarian class feature.

**Graviton Crush (Su)** A periastra can crush an enemy with gravity; this is a ranged attack with a range of 30 feet and that targets EAC. A creature hit by graviton crush must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or be entangled. It can attempt a new Fortitude save once per round as a move action. A periastra cannot use graviton crush two turns in a row. If the periastra makes a full attack using graviton crush, it must use graviton crush for both attacks.

**Stellar Revelations (Su)** A periastra can use the blazing orbit and defy gravity solarian stellar revelations. However, it cannot use the same revelation two turns in a row, and it cannot use both revelations on the same turn.

**Sun Hurl (Su)** A periastra can throw balls of superheated plasma at a foe. This is a ranged attack with a range increment of 30 feet and that targets EAC. A creature hit by sun hurl must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex save or gain the burning condition (1d6 fire damage). This condition doesn’t stack with itself, but does with any other burning condition. The periastra cannot use sun hurl two turns in a row. If the periastra makes a full attack using sun hurl, it must use sun hurl for both attacks.
