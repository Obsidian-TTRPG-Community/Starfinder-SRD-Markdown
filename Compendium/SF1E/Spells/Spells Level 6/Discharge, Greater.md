# Discharge, Greater

**Source**:: _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 350_  
**Classes**:: Technomancer 6  
**School**:: abjuration  
**Targets or Area** one creature or technological object, or a 20-ft.-radius burst  

## Description

This spell functions as _discharge_, except it can discharge multiple technological objects. You can use it in one of two ways: an area discharge or a targeted discharge.  
  
**Area Discharge**: When used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Each creature in the area is affected as though by _discharge_ (affecting only one object in the creature’s possession), and each unattended object is similarly affected.  
  
**Targeted Discharge**: If this spell targets a single creature, it can discharge one randomly determined object from the target’s charged or electrically powered possessions for every 4 caster levels you have.
