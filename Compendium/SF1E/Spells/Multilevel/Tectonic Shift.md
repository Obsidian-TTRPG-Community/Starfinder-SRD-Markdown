## DESCRIPTION

You create the sensation of a massive earthquake for a short period of time, causing affected creatures to become unsteady on their feet.  
**1st:** When you cast tectonic shift as a 1st-level spell, you can target a creature within close range (25 feet + 5 feet/2 levels). The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shaken for 1 round.  
**2nd:** When you cast tectonic shift as a 2nd-level spell, you can target a creature within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). The target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. A creature that fails the save by 5 or more is knocked prone.  
**3rd:** When you cast tectonic shift as 3rd-level spell, you can target up to 5 creatures within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). Each target must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shaken for 1d4 rounds. Creatures that fail the save by 5 or more are stunned for 1 round and knocked prone.
