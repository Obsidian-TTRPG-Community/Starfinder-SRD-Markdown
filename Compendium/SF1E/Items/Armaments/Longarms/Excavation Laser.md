# Excavation Laser

This sturdy, snub-nosed laser rifle resembles a starship’s mining laser in miniature. It fires a powerful beam that loses intensity after a relatively short distance, which makes it not only useful in many mining and quarrying endeavors but also effective in medium-range combat for those trained in its use. Most technologically advanced civilizations develop excavation lasers, and the tools are commonly seen in the hands of workers from the Ulrikka Clanholdings and other miners in the Diaspora. Light, medium, and heavy excavation lasers all see extensive use.

### Laser Weapons

Laser weapons emit highly focused beams of light that deal fire damage. These beams can pass through glass and other transparent physical barriers, dealing damage to such barriers as they pass through. Barriers of energy or magical force block lasers. Invisible creatures don’t take damage from lasers, as the beams pass through them harmlessly. Fog, smoke, and other clouds provide both cover and concealment from laser attacks. Lasers can penetrate darkness, but they don’t provide any illumination.

Laser weapons use various means to concentrate beams of light into deadly intensity. Some focus light through a faceted crystal, while others focus the beam through a chemical cloud or ionized gas.
