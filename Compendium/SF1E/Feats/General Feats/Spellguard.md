Benefit: As a reaction when an adjacent ally is targeted by a spell or spell-like ability, you can create a minor protective ward, granting that ally a +2 insight bonus to their saving throw against that effect. This effect distracts you from your own defenses, and you take a –2 penalty to saving throws against spells and spell-like abilities until the beginning of your next turn. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until you regain Stamina Points with a 10-minute rest.
Prerequisites: Mysticism 3 ranks.
