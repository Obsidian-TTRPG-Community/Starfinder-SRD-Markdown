# KEENING LARYNX
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 96_  
**System** Throat  
A keening larynx necrograft completely replaces your vocal cords. As a standard action a number of times per day equal to the necrograft’s mark, you can emit an ear-piercing wail infused with despair. The target or targets must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or become deafened and take a –1 penalty to weapon damage rolls for 1d4 minutes. This is a sense-dependent effect.  
  
A mk 1 keening larynx can affect a single target within 30 feet of you. A mk 2 keening larynx can affect all targets in a 15-foot cone. A mk 3 keening larynx can affect all targets in your choice of a 20-foot cone or a 30-foot line. A mk 4 keening larynx can affect all targets in your choice of a 30-foot cone or a 40-foot line. A mk 5 keening larynx can affect all targets in your choice of a 45-foot cone or a 60-foot line.
