## Description

You transform a weapon or suit of armor into an antique version of itself, giving it the analog and archaic properties. Any technological or hybrid armor upgrades cease to function for the duration of the spell. Entirely magical enhancements, such as weapon fusions, continue to function normally. Weapons that normally deal energy damage deal bludgeoning and piercing damage instead, lose any critical hit effects, and target KAC. Other weapon special properties, such as boost and bright, might also cease to function for the duration of the spell, at the GM’s discretion.  
This spell has no effect on natural weapons and weapons entirely of magical or supernatural origins, such as a solarian’s solar weapon.
