# PHOTOENERGETIC NODE
**Source** _Alien Archive 2 pg. 125_  
**Item Level** 2; **Price** 625; **System** Hand  
Implanting a tashtari’s photoenergetic node into your hand causes the appendage to glow with faint light. As a move action, you can discharge energy stored in your photoenergetic node into an analog melee weapon that you are currently holding in the same hand that has this biotech augmentation installed. The released energy instantaneously superheats the melee weapon, causing the weapon to deal 1d6 additional fire damage on a successful attack. The affected weapon deals this additional damage for 1 round for every 2 character levels you have. While heated, the affected weapon also sheds light as a flashlight, lantern, or beacon (you choose when you activate the augmentation). Once you’ve expended your photoenergetic node, you can’t use it again until you’ve rested for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points, but you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recharge it immediately.
