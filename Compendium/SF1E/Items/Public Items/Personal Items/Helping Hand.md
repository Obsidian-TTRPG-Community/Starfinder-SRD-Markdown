### Description

This foot-wide circular platform generates a weak anti-gravity field when activated, causing it to hover up to 4 feet above any solid surface like a small floating table. A helping hand can support up to 1 bulk; twice this value causes the device to gently descend, and any more causes it to plummet to the ground. It cannot move horizontally unless pushed or pulled. The helping hand requires a battery and uses 1 charge per 10 minutes of use.
