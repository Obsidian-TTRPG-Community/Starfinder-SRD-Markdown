ABOUT

A cutthroat lawyer is a master of loopholes, doublespeak, intimidation, and litigation. She prides herself on doing whatever it takes—within the law—to win her case. The lawyer has a network of contacts, observers, and expert witnesses ready to help investigate, often including less- skilled lawyers (use the successful merchant statblock) hoping to gain some prestige by association, as well as investigator wizards and sometimes informants from the wrong side of the law, such as dealers, prostitutes, con artists, and street thugs.
