## DESCRIPTION

You create up to four lights that resemble small headlights or flashlights. The dancing lights must stay within a 10-foot-radius area in relation to each other but otherwise move as you desire: forward or back, up or down, straight or turning corners, or the like. The lights can move up to 100 feet per round. A light winks out if the distance between you and it exceeds the spellâ€™s range.

You can have only one _dancing lights_ spell active at a time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.
