Cobbled together from ancestral memories, old records, and scraps from fallen civilizations, Daimalkan mechs are among the most well-honed in the galaxy, and for good reason, as theyâ€™re the only line of defense against the colossi who desire to destroy all life on Daimalko.  
The dire lack of resources on the apocalypse-ravaged world makes the existence of these mechs all the more impressive, not to mention their ability to hold their own against the massive, destructive creatures that roam the planet.  
Towering testaments to ingenuity and perseverance, Daimalkan mechs sometimes incorporate the bones, teeth, scales, or even sinews of the titans they fell in battle. The structural innovations and novel weaponry born from necessity are seen in new Daimalkan mechs and imitated across the galaxy by other manufacturers that have seen the beast-slayers in action.
