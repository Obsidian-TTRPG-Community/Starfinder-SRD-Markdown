**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 145_  
**Item Level** 6; **Price** 4,000; **System** Brain  
Many sazarons have developed a magical way to deal with their cohabitants—tale-spinning dirindi fabulists—in order to reach the truth of certain matters. A psychic implant in your brain grants you the ability to cast zone of truth once per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level of this effect is equal to your character level.
