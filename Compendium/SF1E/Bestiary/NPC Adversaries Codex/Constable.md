# Constable

With three branches—the Constabulary, Ops, and Overwatch— the Stewards protect people and legal rights within the Pact Worlds. The Constabulary handles planet-side troubles, the Overwatch fleet guards Pact Worlds space, and Ops is usually responsible for gathering intelligence. Although Stewards often function as allies for PCs, they might confront PCs engaged in risky heroics, or a canny villain could frame PCs for high crimes to turn Stewards into fearsome adversaries.

### Special Abilities

**Manacles Training (Ex)** A Stewards constable can wield manacles as though they were a one-handed basic melee weapon with the analog special property. If a manacles attack result would equal or exceed the target’s KAC + 4, the constable can attempt a grapple combat maneuver against the target as part of the attack. If the attack result equals or exceeds the target’s KAC + 13 and the combat maneuver check succeeds, the constable grapples and applies the restraints to the target.

## Description

Constables have much more to do than chasing criminals— constables patrol neighborhoods, assist in investigations, guard visiting dignitaries, provide disaster relief, and more. Constables have limited authority to deputize capable bystanders like adventurers to help contain a threat.
