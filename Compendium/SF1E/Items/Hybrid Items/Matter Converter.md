# Matter Converter

This empty box is 1-foot square and lined with glass panels and steel plates. As a full action, you can seal a consumable item (such as a grenade or serum) into the box and activate it. Once activated, the matter converter destroys the object sealed inside the box, consuming it in a black void, and then creates a new consumable item in its place. This new item must have an item level up to one level lower than the item consumed by the matter converter, with a maximum level based on its type. A mk 1 matter converter can create an item with a level no higher than level 5. A mk 2 matter converter can create an item with a level no higher than 10. A mk 3 matter converter can create an item with a level no higher than 15.  
A matter converter takes 1 round per level of the created item to generate the replacement item. An item created in this way is of average quality and has the statistics for an ordinary item of its type.
