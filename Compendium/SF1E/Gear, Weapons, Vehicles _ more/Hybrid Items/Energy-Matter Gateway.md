# ENERGY-MATTER GATEWAY

### DESCRIPTION

An inert _energy-matter gateway_ is a black cube composed of aligned tubes. When you activate the gateway as a standard action, you designate creatures that can benefit from it. The cube’s tubes realign 1 round later to form a 10-foot-tall, hollow monolith that glows with an untapped power. Once active, an _energy-matter_ gateway creates a magical field in a 60-foot-radius spread. An _energy-matter gateway_ can be deactivated as a move action, whereupon it folds back up into its cubic form.  
  
A designated creature within the magical field of an activated _energy-matter gateway_ can spend 1 Resolve Point to tap into the gateway’s field for 1 minute. If such a creature uses a weapon that consumes standard ammunition, the monolith magically produces the ammunition as it’s used. When a creature is tapped into the field, its battery-operated equipment consumes no charges.
