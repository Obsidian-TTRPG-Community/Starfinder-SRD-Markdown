Contemplatives can apply their extreme intelligence to just about any situation. This augmentation overstimulates your brain with tiny electrical charges when you need it most. Once per day before attempting a skill check or saving throw against a creature, you can use your bonus for the skill associated with that creature’s type (such as Life Science for an ooze or Mysticism for an outsider) in place of your normal bonus.
