## Description

You alter the gravity in an area, making a central point of high gravity that pulls creatures toward it. Each creature in the area when the spell takes effect is knocked prone unless it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw. Any creature that starts its turn in the area must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be drawn 15 feet closer to the center of the area. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Creatures adjacent to the spell’s origin point take a –2 penalty to the save to avoid being pulled.
