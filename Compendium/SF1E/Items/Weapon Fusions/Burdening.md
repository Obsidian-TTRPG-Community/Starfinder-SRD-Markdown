Effect: First commissioned by the wardens of the prison-planet Daegox 4 and now used in prisons throughout Near Space, the _burdening_ weapon fusion often bears chains or manacles. When you score a critical hit using a weapon with the _burdening_ fusion, the target gains the encumbered condition for 1d4 rounds. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the _burdening_ effect.
