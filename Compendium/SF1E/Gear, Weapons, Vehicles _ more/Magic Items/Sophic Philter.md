### DESCRIPTION

Emitted from a willing philosopher worm’s magical cells, a _sophic philter_ grants you a brief vision that attempts to answer whatever question is foremost in your mind when you drink it. This vision functions as if you cast a _divination_ spell, but you spend no Resolve Point and have no chance of failure. In addition, tiny glowing runes matching the worm’s appear on or around your sensory organs, granting you a +4 insight bonus to Diplomacy checks against insectile creatures of any creature type for 1 week.
