## Description

Manufactured by the Allied Arms Corporation (AAC) of Triaxus, the Dyad is a mainstay of the Skyfire Legion’s mercenary fleet. From escorting corporate mining expeditions to providing an orbital guard for fledgling colonies operating outside Steward protection, variations of the Dyad have defended against space pirates and raiders for generations. Most Skyfire Legion Dyad crews consist of a bonded ryphorian-dragonkin pair whose near-telepathic connection enables flawless teamwork. Even those who manage to steal a Dyad often find the vessel doesn’t handle well for unfamiliar pilots—not only thanks to the oversized back seat built for a dragonkin’s frame, but also because the controls are infamously finicky if the operators don’t carefully coordinate their movements.  
  
Dyads typically deploy in fleets up to 16 strong, supported by an AAC Hoardmaster, the Skyfire Mandate’s premier carrier (page 110). The smaller fighters occasionally operate independently for several weeks at a time when patrolling protected space or tracking a posted bounty. For a starship designed for long-range escort missions, the Dyad has only minimal amenities, with most spaces awkwardly constrained by the starship’s impressive arsenal. Even so, a Dyad’s aft crew space contains a miniature cargo closet where dragonkin co-pilots often store their “hoards” of personal armaments. These compartments, coupled with the vessels’ military renown, make decommissioned Dyads highly desirable for both legal and illicit cargo-hauling operations.  
  
Corporations occasionally employ Dyads when operating within lawless sectors because of their intimidation factor. Pirates and Free Captains tend to provide wide berth to a Dyad after spotting its distinctive forward-swept wings, preferring to target easier prey rather than risk incurring the wrath of the Skyfire Legion. On the other hand, those criminals fortunate enough to steal and retrofit a Dyad can exploit the Legion’s vaunted reputation to approach and overpower cargo vessels before their crews are any the wiser. The Skyfire Legion takes such instances of mimicry very seriously, either dispatching starships to eliminate the imposters or hiring trusted freelancers to destroy the vessels completely.  
  
Demand for both the Dyad and Hoardmaster spiked after the Pact Worlds’ initial diplomatic missions to the Azlanti Star Empire failed, raising concerns of Azlanti raiders. Even though the Empire hasn’t directly threatened the Pact Worlds in the decades since, the Skyfire Legion has commissioned hundreds more Dyads and accelerated pilot training in response to growing demand for the Legion’s services.
