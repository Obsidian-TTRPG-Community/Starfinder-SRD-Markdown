## DESCRIPTION

This spell causes confusion in all creatures in the area, making them unable to determine their actions. Any confused creature that is attacked automatically attacks or attempts to attack its attackers on its next turn, as long as it is still confused at the start of its next turn. Note that a confused creature will not make attacks of opportunity against any foe that it is not already devoted to attacking (either because of its most recent action or because it has just been attacked). For confused creatures that have not been attacked, roll on the following table at the start of each affected creature’s turn each round to see what it does in that round.  
  

| D%     | Behavior                                                  |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| 1–25   | Act normally.                                             |
| 26–50  | Do nothing but babble incoherently.                       |
| 51–75  | Deal 1d8 + Str modifier damage to self with item in hand. |
| 76–100 | Attack nearest creature.                                  |

  
A confused creature that can’t carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused target.
