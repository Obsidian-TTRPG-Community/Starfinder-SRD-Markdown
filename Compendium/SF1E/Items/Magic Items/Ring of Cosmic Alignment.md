### Description

This majestic ring is forged from twin bands of mithral and adamantine. If you have the stellar mode class feature, whenever you start a turn of combat attuned to a stellar mode and choose to become unattuned, you can immediately gain 1 attunement point for the stellar mode that opposes the mode you began your turn in. For instance, if you began the turn in photon mode and choose to become unattuned, you can use the ring to gain 1 graviton attunement point. Using this ability is a swift action.
