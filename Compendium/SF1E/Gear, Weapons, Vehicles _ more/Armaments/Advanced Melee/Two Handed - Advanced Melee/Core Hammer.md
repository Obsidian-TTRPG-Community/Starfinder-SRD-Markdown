# CORE HAMMER
The hollow head of this two-handed hammer is filled with exceptionally dense plasma, which is released on contact with enemies, sometimes even spraying plasma on a wellplaced strike. Core hammers constructed by the followers of Angradd tend to be functional works of dark metal, where vesk models are usually designed to display the plasma behind magnetic containment. Tactical core hammers and advanced core hammers contain a stable plasma core, while fusion core hammers and reactor core hammers employ devices that focus plasma to trigger momentary flares of nuclear fusion.

### PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
