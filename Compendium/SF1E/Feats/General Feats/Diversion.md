Benefit: When you successfully use Bluff to create a distraction, you can allow an ally to attempt a Stealth check to hide (instead of attempting to hide yourself). You can attempt to allow multiple allies to use Stealth to hide, but you take a –5 penalty to your Bluff check for every ally after the first, and on a failed check no ally can attempt to hide.
