The glaive is an ancient weapon, originally developed for use by and against mounted warriors. The meteor glaive is the Skyfire Legionâ€™s update on the original design, incorporating a petrol tank near the base of the slightly curved blade and relying on a long shaft to keep the wielder at a safe distance. Meteor glaives are classified into tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon models.

# Flame Weapons

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
