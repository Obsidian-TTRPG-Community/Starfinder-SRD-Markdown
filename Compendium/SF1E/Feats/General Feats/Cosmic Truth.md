Benefit: As a standard action, you can spend 1 RP to force one creature within 30 feet of you to attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + half your ranks in Bluff + your Wisdom bonus); if it fails, it is confused for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature has seen or heard you use this ability, it is immune to your further uses of the ability for 24 hours. This is a language-dependent, sense-dependent ability.
Prerequisites: Wis 15, Bluff 5 ranks, Mysticism 5 ranks.
