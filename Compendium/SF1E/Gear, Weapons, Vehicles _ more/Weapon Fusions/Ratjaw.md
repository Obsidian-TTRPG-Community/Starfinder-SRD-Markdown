Effect: Famously linked to criminals who worship Lao Shu Po, the _ratjaw_ fusion aids in disarming and robbing foes. On a critical hit, the weapon knocks an item of your choice out of the target’s possession, as long as it something that could be removed with a successful disarm combat maneuver. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or this disarming ability. If the _ratjaw_ weapon is a ranged weapon, the disarmed item lands in any square of your choice adjacent to the target. If the _ratjaw_ weapon is a melee weapon, it draws the item to you, and you can grab the item with a free hand.
