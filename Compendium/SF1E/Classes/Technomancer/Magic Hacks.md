# MAGIC HACKS
You learn your first magic hack at 2nd level and an additional hack every 3 levels thereafter. Magic hacks require you to be a certain level and are organized accordingly.  

## 2ND LEVEL

You must be 2nd level or higher to choose these magic hacks.  

### CALCULATE TRAJECTORY (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 93_  
As a move action, you can predetermine all potential outcomes and variables before attacking a foe with a spell to consistently strike them at their most vulnerable spot, forcing the target to rely on its reflexes to avoid your attack. If you cast a spell that requires a melee attack or ranged touch attack to affect a target before the end of your next turn, you automatically hit your target, but your foe can attempt a Reflex save to negate your spell’s effect (calculating your spell’s save DC normally). 

###  COUNTERTECH (SU)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 120_  
As a reaction when you take damage from an attack by a technological weapon or source within medium range that specifically targets you, you can expend an unused spell slot to disrupt the attack. With a spell slot of 1st to 5th level, you can counter an attack from a technological weapon whose item level is equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot × 3, to a maximum of your caster level. 6th-level spell slots can counter any weapon with a level equal to or less than your caster level. For example, at 2nd level, you could expend a 1st-level spell slot to counter an attack from a 1st- or 2nd-level weapon. To successfully counter the attack, you must roll a countertech check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the weapon’s level. If the countertech check succeeds, the attack deals half damage. If the countertech check fails, the attack deals normal damage. This magic hack only affects attacks that target you directly; you cannot use countertech against attacks that target an area or that target another person. 

###  DEGRADE HANDLING (EX)
**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to degrade the navigational machinery of a vehicle within 30 feet. You reduce the target’s Piloting modifier by an amount equal to the expended spell level, and the effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. Alternatively, you can instead target a starship with a range of 1 hex as a special crew action during the gunnery phase, reducing the target’s Piloting modifier by an amount equal to the expended spell slot’s level until the end of the next round. 

###  DIRECT DENIAL OF SHAPECHANGING (SU)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
When you cast a polymorph spell on a target with the shapechanger subtype and that target attempts to end your polymorph effect using its change shape ability, that foe must attempt a Will save. If the foe fails its Will save, it fails to transform into the form allowed by its change shape ability and can’t attempt to do so again for the rest of your polymorph spell’s duration. 

###  EMPOWERED WEAPON (SU)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
As a move action, you can expend an unused spell slot to reconfigure and enhance a weapon you’re wielding. Until the start of your next turn, your attacks with the enhanced weapon gain a bonus to attack rolls equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. In addition, your attacks with that weapon deal 1d6 additional damage per level of the expended spell slot. This damage is of the same type the weapon normally deals. 

###  ENERGIZE SPELL (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
Once per day as a move action, you can use a battery or a weapon’s power cell to power your spellcasting, enabling you to cast one spell you know without using a spell slot. This expends 20 charges per spell level from the battery or power cell and requires you to touch the battery, power cell, or weapon. You must cast the spell before the start of your next turn, or the charges are wasted with no effect. 

###  EXTEND PROTECTIONS (SU)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 28_  
As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to recharge the number of days a suit of armor you touch can sustain its environmental protections by one day per level of the spell slot expended. 

###  FABRICATE TECH (SP)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily construct a piece of technological gear from raw magic. You can create any single technological item with a level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot × 3, to a maximum of your caster level. The item appears in your hands or in an adjacent square. You can use fuse spells with this magic hack. The size of the item cannot exceed 10 bulk or Medium size, and the quality of the item is average. Treat this as a spell of the same level as the expended spell slot. For example, at 4th level, you could expend a 1st-level spell slot to fabricate an item of up to 3rd level, or you could expend a 2nd-level spell slot to fabricate an item of up to 4th level. The item persists for a number of minutes equal to your technomancer level. At the end of this duration, the item disappears. You can’t create armor, weapons, magic items, or items with limited uses or charges (such as batteries, drugs, or fuel) with this hack. 

###  GREMLIN COMPANION (SU)
**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 34_  
Your magic has attracted an adoring gremlin that helps you sabotage and control technology. This gremlin is a special creature companion that you immediately obtain and bond with, granting you the Creature Companion Adept feat. You can use Mysticism ranks in place of Survival ranks to qualify for the Creature Companion Expert, Creature Companion Master, and creature Companion Virtuoso feats. If your gremlin companion dies, you can conjure and bond with a new gremlin companion 24 hours later as part of a ritual that takes 8 hours to complete. Your companion has the following statistics. 

###  HARMFUL SPELLS (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage, you can increase the spell’s damage by half your technomancer level. This increased damage applies to all creatures damaged by an area spell, but for spells that target multiple creatures with multiple rays or other attacks (such as _magic missile_), the increased damage applies only to a single ray or missile. This increased damage doesn’t apply to ongoing damage from the spell (such as bleed or burn). This magic hack doesn’t increase ability damage or other spell effects, only damage to Stamina Points or Hit Points. 

###  MAGIC TRAJECTORIES (SU)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
As a move action, you can augment a technological powered weapon (either a ranged energy weapon or a melee weapon with the powered weapon special property) so its wielder can exclude a number of targets equal to your key ability modifier from any attacks made by the weapon for 5 rounds. You can do this to a weapon in your possession or one held by an ally that is within reach at the time you use this ability. Each time an attack is made with the weapon, the attacker can exclude targets they are aware of. This exclusion applies only to instant effects and critical hit effects, such as damage or bleed, not lingering secondary effects such as creating a cloud of smoke.  
After you use this ability, you cannot do so again until after you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points. 

###  QUICK SCAN (SU)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
As a standard action, you can get a general sense of what information is stored on drives or other digital storage media. You must pass your hand in the air near the data source, but don’t have to touch it or connect to it. The information you get is very general, such as “financial records,” “military records,” or “spells.” Getting detailed information requires interfacing with the data more directly. If you attempt a quick scan on a creature that stores its memories in a digital medium—to get a sense of the memories stored in a robot, for example—the target can attempt a Will save to negate the scan and prevent you from trying against it again for 24 hours. 

###  RECODE GEM (SU)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 156_  
You can alter the spell contained within the encoded lattices of a _spell gem_. This requires 1 minute of uninterrupted concentration. You hijack the power within the gem by inserting your own spellcode, replacing the spell originally encoded within the gem with one of your spells known of an equal or lower level. You can’t insert a replacement spell with expensive material components or that requires the expenditure of Resolve Points unless the original spell required components of equal or greater value or the same amount of Resolve Points. If you use this ability on a compound spell gem, it affects only one spell contained within the gem, leaving the other spell or spells intact. Once you have used this ability, you cannot recode another spell gem until you rest for 10 minutes and expend 1 Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points. 

###  REROUTE TRAP (SU)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 28_  
As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to rearrange the inner workings of a mechanical or technological device you touch. Reduce the DC of skill checks to disable the device by an amount equal to the level of the spell slot expended for 1 minute. If you fail a check to disable the device by 5 or more during this time, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to avoid triggering the device. 

###  ROBOT INFLUENCE (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
You can affect constructs, robots, and other creatures that have the technological subtype with your mind-affecting spells, even if they’re mindless or normally immune to such effects. However, they receive a +2 bonus to their Will saves against your mind-affecting spells. 

###  SCRAMBLE COMMUNICATIONS (EX)
**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
As a standard action, you scramble the signal of all technological communication devices in a 5-foot burst within 30 feet. For 1 minute, the devices can’t connect to the infosphere and can’t be used to send messages or communications. If you spend 1 Resolve Point as an additional cost to activate scramble communications, the duration increases to 1 hour. If the device is in a creature’s possession, that creature can attempt a Will save to negate the effect. Once per minute as a full action, a creature adjacent to an affected device can attempt a Computers check (DC = 10 + your technomancer level + your Intelligence modifier + your insight bonus granted by techlore), ending this magic hack’s effect on that device if successful. After you have attempted to scramble a device with this magic hack, that device becomes immune to scramble communications for 24 hours. 

###  SELECTIVE TARGETING (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
When you cast an instantaneous spell with an area effect, you can shape the spell so it doesn’t affect one of your allies. Choose one 5-foot square within the spell’s area to be unaffected by the spell. At 5th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to exclude any number of squares with this ability. 

###  SPELL COUNTERMEASURES (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
You gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against spells and other magical effects. 

###  SUMMON CACHE (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 156_  
As a standard action, you can teleport your spell cache to your hand, even if another creature is currently holding it. This ability functions across any distance, as long as your spell cache is on the same plane as you, though it can’t teleport through effects that prevent teleportation. You can choose this magic hack only if your spell cache is an item. ##  Technomantic Proficiency (Ex)

### TECHNOMANTIC PROFICIENCY (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to temporarily learn how to use a weapon in combat. Choose a single weapon; you gain proficiency with it (and any identical weapon) for a number of minutes equal to your class level. Each round you use the weapon reduces this magic hack’s duration by 1 minute. For example, at 4th level, you could gain proficiency with corona laser rifles for 4 minutes. If you fire such a weapon for 2 rounds, you remain proficient with it for 2 more minutes. 

###  TECHNOMANTIC SHIELD

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 35_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to draw a shield and gain proficiency with that type of shield for 1 minute. 

###  VITAL CONVERSION (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 35_  
As a reaction when you use a spell to deal damage to a creature within 10 feet of you, you can convert some of that creature’s vital energies into electrical power. One battery in your possession regains a number of charges equal to the half the damage dealt or twice the spell’s level, whichever is less.

## 5TH LEVEL

You must be 5th level or higher to choose these magic hacks.  

###  ADAPTABLE SPELL KNOWLEDGE (EX)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
Choose three technomancer spells that you do not know, each with a level equal to or less than the highest spell level you can cast. As a move action, you can add one of these spells to your list of technomancer spells known for 1 minute. If you have the cache capacitor class feature and you could add that spell to one of your cache capacitor’s slots, you can add the spell to your cache capacitor during this time to extend its duration as described by that class feature. You can use this ability multiple times each day, but each time you use it after the first in a single day, you must spend 1 Resolve Point. If you use adaptable spell knowledge again before the duration expires, you replace the previous spell with your new choice. Each time you gain a technomancer level, you can replace one spell you selected with this ability with another choice. 

###  AMPLIFY DRIFT ENGINE (SU)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
You can attune to a Drift engine to amplify its powers. Attuning to a Drift engine is a 10-minute process, at the end of which you must spend 2 Resolve Points that you can’t recover until you’re no longer attuned to the Drift engine. The attunement ends when you leave the starship or spend a full action to end the attunement.  
While you’re attuned to a Drift engine, you treat the engine rating as though it were one higher, though this can’t grant a starship an effective engine rating higher than its size would normally allow. This benefit doesn’t stack with other effects that increase a Drift engine’s effective engine rating. To gain this benefit, you must remain attuned to the Drift engine for the entirety of the starship’s Drift voyage; if you become unattuned, the travel time increases, instead using its base engine rating to calculate the trip’s duration. While attuned to a Drift engine, you also apply your techlore bonus to Piloting checks you make to control the starship.

###  CACHE CONCENTRATION (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of concentration, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to automate the concentration process by transforming the necessary concentration into a program loop that your spell cache can maintain for you. If the spell has a maximum duration, your spell cache maintains the spell for that maximum duration, during which you can act normally. Otherwise, your spell cache maintains the spell until you interrupt the program loop, which does not require an action. Your spell cache can loop only one spell at a time, and if you use this ability to loop a new spell while your spell cache is already looping a spell, the spell cache immediately stops concentrating on the previous spell.  
You must have the spell cache class feature to choose this magic hack. 

###  CHARGING JOLT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 121_  
As a move action, you can expend an unused spell slot to refill charges in a weapon’s power cell. This requires you to touch the weapon or its power cell. The power cell regains 10 charges per spell level, up to its capacity. You can also use this ability to jump-start or short out an electronic device, allowing you to attempt an Engineering check to disable a device with a bonus equal to double the level of the spell you expended. 

###  DEBUG SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
Any piece of code has bugs, but you can turn the bugs in your spellcode into features. After rolling damage for an instantaneous spell that deals Hit Point damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll one die with a result of 1 (see page 243). At 11th level, you can reroll up to two dice with a result of 1, and at 17th level, you can reroll up to three dice with a result of 1. For example, if you were 17th level and cast _disintegrate_, you could spend 1 Resolve Point to reroll up to three dice that rolled 1s, after rolling and seeing how many 1s you rolled. 

###  DISTANT SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
When you cast a spell with a range of close, medium, or long, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to double its range. Spells whose ranges are not defined by distance, as well as spells whose ranges are not close, medium, or long, do not benefit from this magic hack. If the spell affects an area, doubling its range doesn’t alter the size of its area. 

###  ENCHANTED FUSION (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 156_  
As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily grant the effects of a weapon fusion to a weapon that you touch. When you activate this ability, choose from the following weapon fusions: _flaming_, _frost_, _ghost killer_, _merciful_, or _shock_. If you expend a spell slot of 4th, 5th, or 6th level, you gain the ability to choose either the _corrosive_ or _thundering_ fusion. The weapon gains the chosen fusion for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. The weapon can’t gain a fusion it already has or one that can’t be applied to a weapon of its type, but this bonus fusion doesn’t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the weapon can have at once. You must have the empowered weapon magic hack to choose this magic hack. 

###  ENERGY ALTERATION (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
When you cast a spell that deals damage with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can cast the spell as a full action to change the type of damage it deals to any one of the following: acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. If the spell requires an attack roll to hit, changing its damage type does not change whether it targets EAC or KAC. You can spend 1 Resolve Point when casting a spell that deals damage to apply the effects of this magic hack without adjusting the spell’s casting time. 

##  EXTEND TELEPORTATION (SU)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
When you cast a spell from the conjuration (teleportation) school with a casting time of 1 standard action, you can cast the spell as a full action to double the range of the spell. You can spend 1 Resolve Point when casting a spell from the conjuration (teleportation) school to apply the effects of this magic hack without adjusting the spell’s casting time. 

###  EXTENDED SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to double its duration. This has no effect on spells with a duration of concentration, instantaneous, 1 round or less, or permanent, nor can it increase a spell’s duration to more than 24 hours. 

###  FABRICATE ARMS (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily construct a technological weapon or suit of armor out of raw magic. You can create one suit of armor or weapon with a level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot × 3, to a maximum of your caster level. The item appears in your hands, on your person, or in an adjacent square. You can use fuse spells with this magic hack. A weapon can’t be larger than two-handed, and the size of the item can’t exceed 10 bulk. The quality of the item is average for its type. Treat this as a spell of the same level as the expended spell slot. For example, at 10th level, you could expend a 3rd-level spell slot to fabricate a weapon of 9th level or lower, or expend a 4th-level spell slot to fabricate a suit of armor of 10th level or lower. The armor or weapon persists for a number of rounds equal to your technomancer level. At the end of this duration, the item disappears. You are proficient with (but not specialized in) any weapons you create with this ability. You can’t create magic items, weapons made from a special material, or weapons that are expended with use (such as arrows, grenades, or missiles) with this magic hack. 

###  GLITCH STEP (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
You can expend a 1st-level or higher spell slot to glitch yourself out of reality, as if you were an image on a bad view screen, allowing you to move in unpredictable ways. You must use this ability as part of a move action to move your speed or a withdraw action, and it provides you with one of the following benefits. You can use this ability only once per move action.

-   Ignore 20 feet of difficult terrain. This increases to 40 feet of difficult terrain if you expend a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, and 60 feet of difficult terrain if you expend a 5th- or 6thlevel spell slot.
-   Move 10 feet. This counts as 5 feet of movement, but you do not provoke attacks of opportunity when moving this way. Any other movement you attempt as part of your move action provokes reactions as normal. This increases to 20 feet if you expend a 3rd- or 4th-level spell slot, and 30 feet if you expend a 5th- or 6th-level spell slot.
-   Pass through up to 1 foot of solid objects as if you were incorporeal (Core Rulebook 264). You can pass through ceilings, floors, and walls, provided they’re no thicker than 1 foot. 

###  INSTANT UPGRADE (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 28_  
As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to temporarily create and install an armor upgrade into a suit of armor you touch. The armor must have the available armor upgrade slots to accommodate the upgrade, and the upgrade’s item level can’t exceed three times the expended spell slot’s level. The armor gains the chosen upgrade for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence bonus.  
If the upgrade requires a standard action or move action to activate a persistent effect, such as a force field’s effect, the creature wearing the armor can choose to activate that effect as part of this magic hack. If the upgrade has a capacity, it comes fully charged. The armor can’t gain an upgrade it already has or one that can’t be installed in armor of its type. 

###  MAGIC NEGATION (SP)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 RP to temporarily suppress magic, as if using dispel magic. Choose either an ongoing spell or a magic item within 30 feet of you. The magical effects of the spell or magic item are suppressed for 1d4 rounds, and then they return. If the spell’s level is higher than you can cast or the item’s level is greater than your level, you can’t suppress it. If you target a spell affecting a creature, the creature can attempt a Will save to stop you from suppressing the spell. ##  Private Hologram (Su)

**Source** _Starfinder The Chimera Mystery pg. 52_  
When you cast a _holographic image_ or _holographic terrain_ spell, you can choose to adjust the illusion’s magical frequency to make it visible only to you and a single target of your choosing within range who you can observe. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to instead make the illusion perceivable to a number of targets equal to your technomancer level. A private hologram can be seen by any effect that allows someone to see invisible creatures. 

###  SHADOW GRENADE (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 94_  
As a standard action, you can create and throw a quasi-real duplicate of a grenade you have in your possession. You don’t need to have the grenade in hand, but you do have to have it easily accessible (essentially any grenade that would be a legal target of the Pull the Pin feat). To use this ability, you must expend a spell slot of a spell level equal to at least half the item level of the grenade to be thrown (minimum spell level 1).  
The shadow grenade acts in all ways like a standard grenade of the type being duplicated, except you are proficient with it, and any creature that makes a saving throw against it is immune to all its effects. If the grenade would not normally allow a saving throw, creatures in its area can attempt a Will save against a DC of 10 + 1/2 your technomancer level + your key ability modifier. This also applies if the grenade requires a saving throw only under specific circumstances that don’t apply to a creature. For example, if you use this ability to create a shadow smoke grenade, any creature that inhales the shadow smoke attempts a Fortitude save as outlined in that item’s description and on a success is immune to all the grenade’s effects (including any cover it would grant). Creatures that do not inhale the grenade’s shadow smoke are still allowed a Will save, as outlined above, to ignore all the grenade’s effects (including cover).  
You can use this ability to duplicate a grenade with a weapon fusion or fusion seal, but for the purpose of determining the level of the spell slot you must expend to use this ability, treat the grenade’s item level as equal to its base item level + the level of any fusions. 

###  SPELL GRENADE (SP)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
You can spend 1 Resolve Point to store a spell with a range of touch in a grenade, allowing you to affect a target within the grenade’s blast radius with the spell. Casting a spell with spell grenade uses the spell’s standard casting time, and throwing the spell grenade is a standard action. You must throw the grenade before the end of your next turn, or the spell is wasted. You are considered proficient with the grenade for this attack. Choose a single target within the grenade’s blast radius; that target is affected by the spell as if you had successfully touched it. The grenade goes off as normal, with all of its usual effects within its blast radius. If you miss the targeted intersection with the grenade, you must choose a target within the grenade’s new blast radius. If there are no suitable targets within the grenade’s blast radius, the spell is wasted. Spells whose ranges are not touch don’t benefit from this magic hack. 

###  TOXIC SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 28_  
When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage and are holding a dose of an injury poison in hand, you can expend the held poison to deliver it through your spell, breaking it down to its components and magically inserting it into your spell’s code. Choose a single target of the spell, or a single target within the spell’s area; if that target is damaged by the spell, they are also subjected to the poison.

## 8TH LEVEL

You must be 8th level or higher to choose these magic hacks.  

### BRAIN HACKER (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 95_  
To you, living brains are merely a type of organic computer, and you’ve learned to hack them as easily as you would an artificial mind. For the purpose of determining the effects of your technomancer spells, you treat all living creatures with an Intelligence score of 12 or higher as if they were both their original type and subtype and constructs with the technological subtype, whichever is more beneficial for you. This ability allows you to heal living creatures with spells like mending and make whole, as if they were constructs. 

###  DIVINER'S TAP (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
You can hack a computer to set up magical surveillance. This takes 10 minutes and requires a successful Computers check against the device’s DC. If you fail, you can’t try again on the same device. On a success, your tap lasts for a number of days equal to your caster level. You can program your tap either to give you general information about user activity on the device or to receive a mental alarm when a user accesses or transmits data about a specific topic (getting an idea of the information found). For instance, a user might hold a video call to talk about your exploits. If you chose to receive general information, you might know that a video call took place but not the call’s topic. If you chose to have the tap receive an alarm when the topic is you, you’d get the gist of the conversation (but not a complete transcript). Setting up a new diviner’s tap ends the duration of any previous one still in effect. 

###  DRONE SUMMONER (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 95_  
When you cast summon creature to summon a robot, you can grant that robot a number of benefits as if it were a mechanic’s drone you controlled. If you summon multiple robots with a single creature summoning spell, you select one of them to receive these benefits. You can give it commands if it is within 100 feet of you, as if you had limited telepathy that functioned with the robot.  
For every 4 caster levels you have, you can select one additional benefit to grant the robot, up to a maximum number of benefits equal to the spell level of the spell you used to summon it. Each time you gain a new technomancer level, you can change what benefits you have selected. When you summon a robot with a summon creature spell (Alien Archive 144), you can decide what benefits it receives from those you have selected, up to its maximum.  
The benefits you can select from include bonus feats and drone mods. The bonus feats you can select from are Blind- Fight, Cleave, Far Shot, Jet Dash, Kip Up, and Mobility. The drone mods you can select from are camera, cargo rack, climbing claws, enhanced senses, hardened AI, hydrojets, jump jets, speed, and tool arm (you must define the tool when you select this benefit).  
You must be able to cast summon creature to summon a robot to select this magic hack.

### EXPANDED CACHE (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 28_  
You expand the selection of spells you can cast with the cache capacitor class feature. Add _comprehend languages_ and _lifting frame_ to the list of spells you can store in your cache capacitor’s first slot. At 12th level, add _mental silence_ and _personal gravity_ to the list of spells you can store in your cache capacitor’s second slot. At 18th level, add _dampening field_ and _instant upgrade_ to the list of spells you can store in your cache capacitor’s third slot. You must know a spell to store it in your cache capacitor. 

###  EXTEND RUNTIME (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 95_  
You hack a spell’s runtime, dramatically increasing its duration. Whenever you cast a spell with a duration of 10 minutes/day or longer and target only yourself, you can either spend 1 Resolve Point or cast the spell using a higherlevel spell slot to increase its duration to 24 hours (D). 

###  FABRICATE EXPLOSIVE (SP)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 156_  
As a full action, you can expend an unused spell slot to concentrate its magical power into a grenade-like matrix of volatile energy. This fabricated explosive can mimic any grenade with an item level equal to or less than the level of the expended spell slot × 3, to a maximum of your caster level. This grenade-like item remains a spell-like ability with a spell level equal to the level of the spell slot you expended, and it cannot be augmented or affected by abilities that affect technological devices or weapons. This explosive is unstable; only you can use it, and you must throw it within a number of rounds equal to the level of the expended spell slot or it dissipates harmlessly. You are considered proficient with the grenade for this attack. Once you have used this ability, you can’t use it again until you rest for 10 minutes and expend 1 Resolve Point to recover Stamina Points. 

###  FLASH TELEPORT (SP)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to teleport up to 30 feet. You must have line of sight to your destination. This movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity. 

###  HOLOGRAPHIC CAMOUFLAGE (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 28_  
As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to hide your presence with holographic camouflage, becoming concealed. If you don’t move or act for 1 round, at the beginning of your next turn, this camouflage renders you invisible until the next time you move or act. Holographic camouflage lasts for a number of minutes equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. ##  Junk Arsenal (Su)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 35_  
You can spend one or more Resolve Points when you cast junk armor or junksword. For each Resolve Point spent, you cause one willing creature you touch while casting the spell to also gain the effects of that spell for 1 hour. Each junk armament created with the spell requires its own supply of junk to transform. The creature uses your technomancer level to calculate the spell’s effects, though the creature’s junk armament does not gain any additional abilities granted by your class abilities (such as the additional armor upgrade slot granted by junk technomancy). For junk armor, you can choose for each target whether to create light armor or temporarily turn the target’s light armor into heavy armor. For junksword, each weapon you create has identical statistics, such as which special properties it has and whether it is analog or powered. 

###  MENTAL MARK (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
When an enemy fails a Will save against one of your technomancer spells, it takes a –2 penalty to saving throws and AC for 1 round. When an enemy succeeds at a Will save against one of your technomancer spells, it takes a –1 penalty to saving throws against your spells for 1 round. A creature can take only one penalty from a mental mark at a time. 

###  SHRINK SHOT (EX)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
Imitating the transitive properties of the Drift, you can warp space to decrease the distance a weapon can fire. As a standard action, you expend an unused spell slot to halve the range increment of a ranged weapon within 100 feet for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot expended. If the weapon is in a creature’s possession, that creature can attempt a Reflex saving throw to negate this effect. 

##  SPELLSHOT (SP)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 122_  
You can cast an area spell with a casting time of 1 standard action or less through a ranged weapon, allowing you to use the weapon’s range rather than the spell’s range. You must target a single creature with your attack, and the spell’s area is centered on that creature, or originates at the creature’s location for a cone or line effect (oriented in whichever direction you choose), even if the spell would normally be centered on or originate from a point. You can fire the weapon as part of the standard action to cast the spell, dealing damage as normal if you hit. You must fire the weapon during the round that the casting is completed, or the spell is wasted. If the attack misses, the spell is wasted. Spells with an emanation effect that would be centered on you don’t benefit from this magic hack. 

###  TECH COUNTERMEASURES (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make it more difficult for enemies to target you with technological weapons for 1 round. Until the start of your next turn, as a reaction just before an enemy attacks you with a technological weapon, you can force that enemy to roll the attack twice and take the lower result; if the weapon allows a Reflex save instead of requiring an attack roll, you instead gain the benefit of evasion (as the operative’s class feature; see page 93) against the attack. This magic hack has no effect on spells that target you or on weapons or attacks that are not technological in nature. 

###  TELEPORT GRENADE (SU)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
When you throw a grenade, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as part of the action to teleport the grenade to its destination. This increases the grenade’s range to 100 feet plus 10 feet for every technomancer level you have, with no range increment. In addition, your attack roll with the grenade ignores partial cover and cover, but not improved cover and total cover. 

###  TRANSLOCATIONAL RECALL (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 95_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to create a translocational beacon that you place anywhere within your reach. As a swift action, you can instantly teleport from your current location to the location where you placed your translocational beacon, provided the beacon has at least 1 Hit Point and is no further than 10 feet × your technomancer level from your current location. This movement doesn’t provoke attacks of opportunity, although it does create a dazzling flash of neon light (Perception DC 0 to notice).  
A transdimensional beacon is a Fine object with negligible bulk, hardness equal to your technomancer level, and Hit Points equal to 3 × your technomancer level. Your spell cache monitors your beacon, and you are automatically alerted if it is destroyed or you move out of its range. You can have only one beacon active at a time, and creating a new beacon causes the old beacon to immediately collapse and become inert. 

###  USURP CODE (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 35_  
You can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you or an adjacent ally successfully saves against a spell to absorb the spell’s formula into your spell cache. The spell’s formula remains in your spell cache for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier, and as a swift action or move action you can attempt to decode the spell by succeeding at a Mysticism check (DC = 10 + 5 × the level of the spell); you can instead attempt a Computers check with the same DC if the spell is on the technomancer spell list. Once you have deciphered the spell, temporarily add it to your list of spells known as a technomancer spell. After you cast this spell, the formula is erased from your spell cache.  
You must have a spell cache to select this magic hack. 

###  WIDENED SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
When you cast a spell with a burst, emanation, or spread, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to double its radius. For instance, a spell with a 30-foot burst would have a 60-foot burst instead. Spells that don’t have an area of one of these three types are not affected by this magic hack.

## 11TH LEVEL

You must be 11th level or higher to choose these magic hacks.  

##  ADAPTIVE DEFENSES (SP)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 29_  
As a standard action, you can expend an unused spell slot to construct magical defenses from the foreign particles in your wounds, granting you resistance to one type of energy damage dealt to you within the past minute. This resistance is equal to your class level and lasts for a number of rounds equal to the level of the spell slot you expended. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to activate this magic hack as a move action. 


###  COUNTERTECH SENTINEL (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use your countertech magic hack to counter a direct attack against an ally within 15 feet. You can’t use countertech sentinel against attacks that target an area. You must have the countertech magic hack to choose this magic hack. 

###  CRITICAL SPELLS

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 35_  
As a move action, you can add one of the following critical hit effects to the next spell you cast this turn that requires an attack roll: arc, burn, corrode, deafen, knockdown, or staggered. Damage dealt by the arc, burn, or corrode effect equals 1d6 × the spell’s level. Any critical hit effect that allows for a saving throw uses your magic hack DC. 

###  DIMINISH SPELL RUNTIME (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 95_  
As a standard action, you can attempt to hack an active spell effect that you’re aware of to reduce its duration. You must be able to touch the area, creature, or object affected by the spell that you want to hack. As part of the hack, attempt a Mysticism check with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 × the caster level of the spell. If you succeed, you reduce the spell’s duration by 50%. If this reduces its duration to less time than the effect has already been active, the spell ends as if dispelled. If you fail the check by 5 or more, you can’t attempt to hack that spell again for 24 hours. This ability does not affect spells with an instantaneous or permanent duration. 

###  ETERNAL SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
Choose one 1st-level spell you know from the list of technomancer spells in the _Starfinder Core Rulebook_. You can cast it at will, as though it were a 0-level spell. It still counts as one of your 1st-level spells known, not one of your 0-level spells known. You can choose a 1st-level spell from a source other than the _Core Rulebook_ with the GM’s permission. 

###  LONG-LASTING SPELL

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 35_  
As a move action, you can spend 1 RP to boost a spell that deals damage and targets a single creature or object. This causes the target to take the spell’s minimum damage again at the start of their next turn. If the initial spell allows for a saving throw to reduce damage, this additional damage also allows for the same saving throw. You can’t use effects that would manipulate damage dice results (such as debug spell) with this ability. 

###  MIND VIRUS (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Hive of Minds pg. 50_  
You implant a psychic countermeasure in your mind to protect against intrusion, much like computer security. When you attempt a Will saving throw against a mind-affecting effect, the creature using the effect on you must also attempt a Will saving throw. On a failure, the target is nauseated for 1d4 rounds. Even if the target succeeds at the Will save, it is sickened for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting effect. 

###  PROXIMITY ALERT (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 29_  
As a standard action, you cause a personal comm unit you touch to sense and transmit subtle electronic impulses back to you. You gain blindsense (electricity) with a range of 30 feet centered on the comm unit. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until you move more than 100 feet from the comm unit. As a move action, you can expend an unused spell slot to also gain blindsight (electricity) with a range of 30 feet centered on the comm unit, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to twice the expended spell’s level. 

###  REACTIVE COUNTER (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 95_  
Whenever an opponent you’re aware of casts a spell, as a reaction you can cast _dispel magic_ or _greater dispel magic_ in an attempt to counter the spell, even if you didn’t ready an action or select that opponent. This magic hack doesn’t allow you to cast a spell that you don’t know, and you must expend a spell slot of the appropriate level to cast _dispel magic_ or _greater dispel magic_ in this way. You must know _dispel magic_ or _greater dispel magic_ to select this magic hack. 

###  REBOOT MIND (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
You can free someone from magical mental control or conditions. As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point and touch a willing creature. This restarts the subject’s brain, ending all mind-affecting effects affecting it, as well as all conditions that could be removed by _greater remove condition_ that were imparted on the creature by mind-affecting effects, but the subject becomes stunned until the end of its next turn. Once you reboot a mind, you can’t use this ability again for 24 hours.

You can attempt to reboot the mind of an ally who is unwilling due to the influence of a mind-affecting effect. In this case, the ally can attempt a new saving throw against the effect at the same DC. If she succeeds, the ally can allow her mind to be rebooted, but if she fails, you waste the expended Resolve Point and action.

You can use this ability to reboot your own mind. If you’re unable to take actions, you can reboot your mind without spending actions, but it must be the first thing you do on your turn, and you are stunned until the end of your next turn. 

###  SEEKING SHOT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to fire a single shot from a ranged weapon at a target known to you within range. The shot travels to the target, even around corners. Only an unavoidable obstacle or the limit of the weapon’s range prevents the shot from reaching the target. This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. 

###  SPELL COUPLING (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 29_  
When you cast an instantaneous spell that deals damage, you can expend an additional unused spell slot to code additional magic energy onto the spell, bolstering its effectiveness. You gain a bonus to your attack roll with the spell equal to half the additional unused spell slot’s level. The spell deals an additional 1d6 damage for every level of the additional unused spell slot. The saving throw DC of the spell increases by 1 if the additional unused spell slot expended is 3rd, 4th, or 5th level, or by 2 if you expended a 6th-level spell slot.  
These benefits apply to all creatures affected by an area spell, but for spells that target multiple creatures with multiple rays or other attacks (such as magic missile), the increased damage applies only to a single ray or missile. This increased damage doesn’t apply to ongoing damage from the spell (such as bleed or burn), nor does it increase ability damage or the spell’s other effects. 

###  SPELL GLITCH (SP)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
As a standard action, you can infect an ongoing spell with a virulent spellcode that swiftly degrades the magic. To infect it, you must be aware of the spell and able to touch the area, creature, or object affected by the spell. As part of the infection, attempt a caster-level check (1d20 + your caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the spell’s caster level. If you succeed, the spell glitches for a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. At the end of each of your turns while the spell is glitching, there is a 25% chance the spell ceases to function until the end of your next turn. If a spell ceases to function 2 consecutive rounds in this way, you can attempt a second caster-level check against the same DC, dispelling the spell as dispel magic if you succeed. Once you have targeted a spell with this magic hack, the spell becomes immune to further uses of spell glitch for 24 hours.

### TRACKING BEACON (SP)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 46_  
You can spend 2 Resolve Points as a standard action to touch a vehicle or starship and infect it with a tracking program that tracks the vehicle on your behalf. The program lasts a number of days equal to your technomancer level, sending real-time coordinates to your spell cache to inform you of the vehicle’s location, whether it’s moving, and its relative status: unharmed, broken (vehicle only), wrecked (vehicle only), damaged (a starship with critical damage to at least one system), disabled (starship only), or destroyed. If the vehicle or starship enters the Drift, the program transmits Drift codes for the starship’s destination, enabling you to plot a course to the same destination.  
A creature interacting with the vehicle can attempt a Computers or Mysticism check once per day to detect your tracking program, with a DC equal to 15 + 1-1/2 your technomancer level. Once detected, your tracking program can be dispelled as if it were a spell, or it can be removed by being hacked as if it were a computer whose tier is equal to half your technomancer level.

## 14TH LEVEL

You must be 14th level or higher to choose these magic hacks.  

##  PERSONAL FIREWALL (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 35_  
You have wrapped yourself in technomagical code that deflects incoming incantations. You gain spell resistance equal to 5 + your technomancer level. Against spells that appear on the technomancer spell list, your spell resistance increases to 10 + your technomancer level. 

###  PHASE SHOT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to fire a single shot from a ranged weapon at a target known to you within range. The shot travels straight to the target, passing through any nonmagical barrier in its way, ignoring hardness and Hit Points (any magical barrier, such as a _wall of force_, stops the shot). This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. 

###  QUICKENED SPELL (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
You can cast a spell as a move action. You can spend 2 Resolve Points to cast a quickened 0-level spell or 4 Resolve Points to cast a quickened 1st-level spell. You can quicken only spells with a casting time of 1 full action or shorter. At 16th level, you can spend 6 Resolve Points to cast a quickened 2nd-level spell. 

###  RAIN OF FIRE (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
Once per day as a full action, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to shoot a ranged weapon at multiple targets within range; the maximum number of targets is equal to half your technomancer level or the number of shots in your weapon, whichever is lower. Each attack uses your highest attack bonus, and each enemy can be targeted only by a single shot. 

###  REBOUNDING SPELL (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 29_  
When a single-target spell you cast fails to affect its target, you can spend 2 Resolve Points as a reaction to redirect the spell onto a new target within the spell’s range. If the spell requires an attack roll, reroll the attack against the new target with a –2 penalty. If the spell requires a saving throw, the new target attempts the saving throw with a +2 bonus. 

###  REWIRE SYNAPSES (SP)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 29_  
Once per day as a full action, you reconfigure the mind of a construct, living creature, or creature with the technological subtype within 60 feet of you and whose CR is lower than or equal to your technomancer level (Will negates). If the target fails the save, choose one of that creature’s allies as well as one of the creature’s foes that both you and the target can perceive with a precise sense. The magic hack causes the target to treat the chosen ally as if they were an enemy, urging the target to attack, harass, or evade that ally. The magic hack’s target also treats the chosen enemy as if they were an ally, compelling the target to protect, aid, and fight alongside that creature. These effects don’t compel the target to attack their new enemy to the exclusion of other targets, but the target does preferentially harm the new enemy when possible.  
This effect lasts a number of rounds equal to your Intelligence modifier. At the end of any turn in which they harmed their new enemy, the target can attempt a new saving throw against this magic hack; if they succeed, the effect ends. 

###  SOUL BACKUP (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 35_  
As part of a ritual that takes 8 hours, during which the subject must remain within 10 feet of you, you can scan and download a compressed copy of a willing creature’s soul into your spell cache. Your spell cache can only store a number of such copies equal to your Intelligence modifier, you cannot store more than one copy of a specific creature’s soul in this way, and you can purge soul data with 1 minute of programming.  
The soul data can be accessed in several ways, but after any of these uses, the decompressed data becomes so expansive that it exceeds your spell cache’s available memory and becomes irrevocably corrupted and unusable. First, a spellcaster can expend the data while casting raise dead on the stored soul’s body to halve the cost of the expensive beacon required by the spell. Second, you can expend the data to interview the subject so long as they are dead, as if casting speak with dead without needing access to the corpse. Finally, you can expend the data as a standard action to rebuff an undead creature made from the subject (such as the subject’s ghost or animated skeleton), with a range of 100 feet; the undead takes 1d20 force damage per technomancer level (Fortitude half). 

###  SPELL LIBRARY (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 123_  
You gain one extra spell known for each level of spell you can cast. You must choose the new spells when you gain this magic hack. If you gain access to a higher level of spell after choosing this hack, you gain one extra spell known for that spell level.

## 17TH LEVEL

You must be 17th level or higher to choose these magic hacks.  

##  PHASING SPELLSHOT (SP)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 156_  
When you use your spellshot magic hack, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a part of casting the spell to allow the attack to travel straight to the target, passing through any nonmagical barrier in its way, ignoring hardness and Hit Points (although any magical barrier, such as a wall of force, stops the shot). This ability negates cover and concealment modifiers, but otherwise the attack is rolled normally. You must have the spellshot and phase shot magic hacks to select this magic hack.
