# Technological Items

**Source** Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 218
Technology is everywhere in Starfinder, and includes any number of devices useful to adventurers, such as those presented on Table 7–26: Technological Items. Unless otherwise indicated, activating or deactivating an item is a standard action. Items that can be activated to modify an action you’re taking last for the duration of that action (such as those that modify [[Skill Checks]]), in which case activating the item is part of that action.  
  
Unless otherwise specified, technological items use a [[Battery]] and are subject to [[Special Abilities]] that work against items using batteries, charges, or technology. If an item doesn’t specify a usage, it needs very little power and has an internal [[Battery]] designed to function for decades or even centuries without recharging. Items with a specified usage use a [[Battery]] that comes fully charged when purchased. Such batteries can be recharged as normal using generators or recharging stations (see Professional Services on page 234), or they can be replaced (see Table 7–9: Ammunition for [[Battery]] prices).

-   **Name**: An item’s name is its colloquial title, a particular brand name, or its scientific name.
-   **Model**: Some items come in multiple versions, each with varying effectiveness. These items list multiple models, with a price and level entry for each.
-   **Price**: This is the price in credits to purchase or craft the item. The prices listed for each item represent common, mass-produced versions of each item. Brand-name items typically cost twice as much, while more luxurious versions can cost three times as much or more.
-   **Level**::: The level of the item is the minimum level you have to be to craft the item, as well as a rough approximation of the item’s effectiveness compared to your character level.
-   **Hands**: If an item is handheld, this entry indicates how many hands you must have free to utilize the item properly and gain its benefits. Most items can be carried in one hand while you’re not using them unless they’re especially unwieldy or heavy, as decided by the GM.
-   
**Bulk**: The item’s bulk (see page 167) appears here.
-   **Capacity**: This lists the maximum capacity for an item that requires charges to function. An item that holds electrical charges can be replenished with a [[Battery]] (see page 190).
-   **Usage**: This entry lists how many charges are consumed when the item is used. This might be per activation, or it might cover a certain duration. If an item uses a certain amount of charges over an interval, it uses charges for the full interval even if the item is shut off before that amount of time has passed. For instance, an item that uses charges at a rate of 2 per minute would still use 2 charges if activated for only 30 seconds.

Of course, there’s a vast array of technological devices available in most settlements—well beyond the number that could possibly be presented in any real-world book. In general, any minor piece of equipment with a real-world equivalent (alarm clock, camera, digital keys for vehicles you own, timer, watch, and so on) can be purchased with GM approval, costs 5 credits and has light bulk.
