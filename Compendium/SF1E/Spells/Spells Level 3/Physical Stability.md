## Description

Drawing upon the order and stability of the lawful outer planes, you stabilize a creature's form with a touch. The target gains a +2 circumstance bonus against transmutation spells and effects. _Physical stability_ counters _baleful polymorph_ and _polymorph_, and it counters and negates _fluidity of form_. If you cast _physical stability_ on a creature already under the effects of a transmutation effect, you can try to dispel one transmutation effect affecting the target. If you do, attempt a dispel check (1d20 + caster level) with a DC equal to 11 + the caster level of the transmutation effect to end the effect.
