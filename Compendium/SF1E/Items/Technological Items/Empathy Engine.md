### Description

This circlet of fine silver wire fits snugly over the cranium, connecting to twin electrodes that adhere painlessly to the temples. This technology first gained popularity with some psychically resistant lashuntas on Castrovel, then spread throughout the Pact Worlds as non-telepathic species adopted it. When worn, this device provides you with a rudimentary form of telepathy. You can’t communicate through the empathy engine using language, but you can share emotions, images, and simplistic concepts with creatures within 30 feet of you. Examples of concepts the device can communicate include “danger,” “help,” and “I won’t hurt you.” Creatures must share a language with you to communicate this way.
