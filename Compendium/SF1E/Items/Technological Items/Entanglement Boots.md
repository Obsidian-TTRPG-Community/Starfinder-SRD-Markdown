### Description

Entanglement badges are crafted in pairs and link those who wear them at a quantum level. An entanglement badge can be activated or deactivated as a move action, and both badges must be worn and activated to function properly. In addition, the wearers of the two badges must be within 200 feet of each other to use them. When the wearer of the linked badge takes damage, you can, as a reaction, reduce the amount of damage they take by half, taking that amount of damage yourself you can’t reduce this damage in any way. Once per day as a reaction, you can use the result of the linked badge’s wearer’s saving throw for an effect that affects you both instead of your own.  
  
Each entanglement badge uses a battery, and each hour of use consumes 2 charges.
