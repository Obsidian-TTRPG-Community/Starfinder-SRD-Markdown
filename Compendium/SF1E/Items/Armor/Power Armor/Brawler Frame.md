Designed for brutal gladiatorial matches against other fighters in powered armor, a brawler frame consists of nanotech shock absorbers sandwiched between rigid metal plates. The default frame comes with blunt piston-powered fists designed to deal bludgeoning damage, but customized models with heavy blades or picks (dealing slashing or piercing damage, respectively) are not uncommon. Many owners paint their brawler frames with garish colors to be more distinctive in the arena.
