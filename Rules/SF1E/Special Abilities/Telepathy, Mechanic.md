## Telepathy, Mechanic

A creature with the telepathy special ability can mentally communicate with any other creature within a certain range (specified in the creatureâ€™s description, though the range of telepathy is usually 100 feet) that knows a language or also has telepathy. It is possible to address multiple creatures at once telepathically, although maintaining a telepathic conversation with more than one creature at a time is just as difficult as simultaneously speaking and listening to multiple people at the same time.
