## DESCRIPTION

You gather mystical energy and blast it outward in a mighty wave originating from your fingertips, damaging and potentially knocking back your enemies. This spell deals 2d6 damage to each creature in the area unless it succeeds at a Reflex saving throw for half damage.

Additionally, the force from this spell effectively attempts to bull rush all creatures in the area. Attempt a single bull rush combat maneuver, using your caster level + your key ability score modifier as your attack bonus. Compare the result to each target’s KAC + 8. If you’re successful, that creature is knocked back 5 feet, plus 5 additional feet for every 5 by which your attack exceeds the creature’s KAC + 8. If there is an obstacle in the way, the creature stops at the obstacle instead.
