Nicknamed the Bat for the scanning arrays affixed to the helmet, this Vercite armor increasingly sees use by bounty hunters specialized in tracking verthani marks. While active, the KashComm scout grants blindsense (sound) with a range of 120 feet. As a standard action, the wearer can devote the armor’s processing fully into its sensors, changing its blindsense to blindsight (sound) until the end of their next turn.
