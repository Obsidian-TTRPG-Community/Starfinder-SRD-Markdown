### Description

A vial of liquid so dark that it seems to absorb nearby light, a serum of long shadows lacks any taste and is always the exact temperature of its imbiber. For 10 minutes after you drink a serum of long shadows, the light within 5 feet of you (including your space) becomes dim light, and only magical sources of light can increase the light level in this area. This effect moves with you. In addition, you take half damage from attacks and effects with the shadow descriptor.
