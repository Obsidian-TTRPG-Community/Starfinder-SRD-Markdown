# Conspiracist

Investigators uncover secrets and sift truth from lies. This often places investigators on the side of the law, but when the powers that be are corrupt, investigators might find themselves labeled vigilantes or ostracized. Yet they aren’t easily discouraged, and can become relentless foes.

### Special Abilities

**Convoluted Conspiracy (Ex)** As a full action, a conspiracist can expound on a brilliantly confusing theory. Each creature within 30 feet of the conspiracist that can hear the conspiracist is dazed for 1 round, unless they succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 11 + CR). Whether or not the creature succeeds at the saving throw, they are then immune to this conspiracist’s convoluted conspiracy for 1 minute. This is a language-dependent, mind-affecting ability.

## Description

Conspiracists are obsessed with the unexplained, their passion often earning them a reputation as eccentric or weird. Yet a conspiracist’s passion sometimes leads them to imagine connections where none exist, getting them into trouble.
