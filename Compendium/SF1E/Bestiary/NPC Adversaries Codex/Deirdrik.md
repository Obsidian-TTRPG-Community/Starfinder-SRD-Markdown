**TACTICS**  
During Combat Deirdrik doesn’t like getting into physical fights, but if forced, she prefers to use her envoy improvisations to keep enemies off-balance. Morale Deirdrik flees as soon as she’s injured and describes the injury in ludicrously exaggerated detail when talking about how badly she was assaulted, which grants her 1 Vote Point in the election if it hasn’t happened yet.
