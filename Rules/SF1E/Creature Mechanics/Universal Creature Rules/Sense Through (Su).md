# SENSE THROUGH (SU)

**Source** _Alien Archive pg. 156_  
The creature can sense through obstacles that would normally block the ability to perceive what is beyond them. The specific sense this ability applies to is indicated in parentheses after the sense through entry in the creatureâ€™s statistics. If the ability allows the creature to sense through only a specific material, that material is listed after the specific sense. For more information on sense through, see page 264 of the _Starfinder Core Rulebook_.

_Format_: **Senses** sense through (vision).
