# Mugger

Thieves are common throughout the galaxy, though more numerous in larger cities and space stations. They have a variety of methods and motivations for snaring others’ property; some thieves strike back against an amoral corporate system that left them behind, while others selfishly prey on those with little power to defend their possessions. PCs can encounter thieves in numerous circumstances, whether as unsavory associates, crafty foes, or on-again-off-again allies and rivals.

### Special Abilities

**Beatdown (Ex)** As a standard action, a mugger can attempt a combat maneuver to trip a target. If this succeeds, the mugger also deals damage equal to one of their melee attacks.  
**Menace (Ex)** As a standard action, the mugger can menace a target, who must succeed at a Will save (DC = 9 + the mugger’s CR) or be forced to follow the mugger’s orders as if affected by _command_. If the target succeeds at their Will save, they’re immune to that mugger’s menace ability for 24 hours.

## Description

Like pickpockets, muggers are common in large cities, but they adopt a strategy of brute force rather than stealth. Most muggers are physically imposing, the better to intimidate their ictims into handing over valuables. They can be among the lower echelons of an organized gang or simply free agents. A mugger might prey on low-level PCs who wander down the wrong alleyway, or the PCs might witness a mugging and wish to help. Most muggers flee if their victims put up a fight, which could provide the opportunity for an exciting chase.
