### Description

This tangy, red beverage bears a label with a frustrated cartoon devil—complete with smoke coming out of its ears—paired with the phrase, “Quench a devil of a thirst!” The serum grants you a +2 insight bonus to saving throws against the spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities of evil outsiders.
