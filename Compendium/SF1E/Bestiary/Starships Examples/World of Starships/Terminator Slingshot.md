## DESCRIPTION

Like many Vercite ships, the Slingshot is notable for its combination of speed and luxury, despite being designed for hauling freight rather than transporting elite clientele. For seasoned personnel, serving aboard a Slingshot—where every crew member has their own stateroom with a full-sized bed and a bathroom with a private shower—may be the most comfortable job they’ve ever had. In addition to these comforts, the Slingshot is famed for its flight performance. Thruster upgrades enable these starships to accelerate from a dead stop to maximum speed in seconds. Cautious merchants love this feature almost as much as the smugglers and pirates who delight in repurposing these vessels for ambushes do.  
  
Over the last few years, the Slingshot has become the blockade runner of choice for Free Captains and other outlaws with a sense of style. These captains know better than to engage in a stand-up fight with a starship intended for the civilian market, and the Slingshot’s defensive weapons are designed to thwart or delay intercepting starships. The Stewards and other law enforcement agencies both hate and grudgingly respect the Slingshot as one of the most frustrating vessels to chase.  
  
Terminator embraced its unusual customer base with a slick advertising campaign that capitalized on the romance associated with space pirates while simultaneously condemning the use of their starships for illicit activities. The latest factory customization options for the Slingshot include paint jobs and interior decor themes that mimic styles popularized by infamous blockade runners in the Pact Worlds—a practice that sometimes results in cases of mistaken identity. Recently, members of a Prelurian Patrol intercepted a Slingshot matching the description of the vessel flown by notorious Free Captain Grazjva the Green, only to find the ship piloted by a middle-aged verthani accountant carrying no illicit cargo aside from a few grams of hyperleaf.  
  
Stock Slingshots have an impressive 175-ton cargo capacity, though many outlaws sacrifice up to 30 tons of cargo space to install dual shielded smuggler compartments. Some smuggler captains prefer to swap out the Slingshot’s default weapons for livelier munitions, but nearly all Slingshot owners enjoy tricking out their vessels with customizable cosmetic options.
