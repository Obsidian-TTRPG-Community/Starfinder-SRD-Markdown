## Description

You instantly copy all data stored on a single computer or secure data module onto another device in your possession with adequate storage capacity.

If the data is encrypted, the data remains encrypted until it has been successfully decrypted with an appropriate skill check. When the spell ends, the duplicated data is erased.
