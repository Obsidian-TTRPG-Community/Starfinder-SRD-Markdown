# SCHOLAR OF MAGIC
Though many are students and educators at formal institutions, scholars are as likely to be solitary academics or self-taught. Adventurers might seek a scholar to decipher a mysterious text or perform a complicated spell. A scholar could be a party’s patron, sending them to retrieve artifacts or data from faraway planets. Villainous scholars might seek nefarious lore or publish dangerously fabricated research for profit or prestige.  
These scholars have Intelligence-focused skills, yet you can replace these skills to represent other studies, such as a scholar of the arts having Profession (painter) instead of Engineering.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Channel Magic (Su)** Before making an attack with a weapon, a scholar of magic can spend 1 Resolve Point and expend a spell slot or spell gem to gain a circumstance bonus to the attack equal to half the spell’s level and a bonus to the attack’s damage equal to 3 × the spell’s level.  
**Ultimate Power (Su)** A scholar of magic can spend 1 Resolve Point when they cast a damaging spell to treat any damage dice that roll a 1 as though they’d instead rolled the maximum result.

## DESCRIPTION

Eminent magical scholars have extensively studied the theory and application of magic and how it interacts with the rest of the universe. They’re often deans of arcane academies, chief magical officers of corporations, or innovators reinventing magic for the next generation. They sometimes hire assistants to participate in dangerous experiments or acquire rare magical objects.
