# Dromada Clutch

### Description

This sleek briefcase can securely hold up to 4 objects of light or negligible bulk. When you purchase a _dromada clutch_ (or have access to one that is unsealed) you can set a command word that magically seals and unseals the briefcase. While sealed, a _dromada clutch_ protects its contents from being viewed—even by x-ray scanners and creatures with sense through. In addition, hybrid and magic _arcane sight_. A sealed dromada clutch acts as a container with a permanent _security seal_ spell and a good lock.
