While analog battle ribbons are the most traditional of such weapons, increased demand for showier displays in recent centuries has resulted in the development of the plasma ribbon. Much like the analog version, a plasma ribbon is a 10-foot-long ribbon about 3 inches wide, though this version is made from impermeable nanocarbon fiber. A series of fine, flexible wires along the edges produces a narrow magnetic field that turns the weapon into a streamer of glowing plasma in use. Student plasma ribbons allow the user to build up proficiency; battleflowers trade up to professional, competitor, and champion plasma ribbons as they become more skilled with the weapons.

# PLASMA WEAPONS

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
