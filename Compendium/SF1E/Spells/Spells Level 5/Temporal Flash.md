## DESCRIPTION

You shift positions in your current timeline to avoid damage dealt by an attack. As a reaction when you're hit by an attack, spell, or other ability that would deal damage to you, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to instantly teleport to an empty space you could reach with a single move action, avoiding the damage you would have taken. This movement doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.
