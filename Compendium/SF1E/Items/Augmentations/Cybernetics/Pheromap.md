# Pheromap

## Pheromap, Basic

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 143_  
**Item Level** 3;
**Price**::  1,300; **System** Brain  
Your olfactory senses are enhanced and connected to the vlaka pheromap, giving you access to the connection between pheromones and emotions for many other species.  
When a living creature is within the radius of your blindsight (scent) as a move action you can attempt a Perception skill check to identify it. The DC of the check is determined by the creature’s rarity, as presented on the Creature Rarity table (Core Rulebook 133). If you have blindsense (scent) or blindsight (scent), you gain a +5 enhancement bonus to this check. If successful, you also determine its initial attitude toward you (Core Rulebook 140). You can attempt this check untrained regardless of the DC, and having this augmentation counts as having access to an information network for the purposes of taking 20 on a check to identify a creature.

This functions as the basic pheromap augmentation (see above), but your pheromap includes more detailed information about familiar species, granting you a +4 insight bonus to Sense Motive checks against living creatures you’ve successfully identified with your pheromap augmentation.
