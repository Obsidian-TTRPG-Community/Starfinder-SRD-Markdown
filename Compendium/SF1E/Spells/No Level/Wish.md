## Description

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter reality to better suit you. Even _wish_, however, has its limits. A _wish_ spell can produce any one of the following effects.

-   Duplicate any technomancer spell of 6th level or lower.
-   Duplicate any other spell of 5th level or lower.
-   Undo the harmful effects of certain spells, such as _feeblemind_.
-   Produce any effect whose power level is in line with the above effects.

At the GM’s discretion, you may try to use a wish to produce greater effects than these, but doing so may be dangerous or the spell may have only a partial effect.

A duplicated spell allows saving throws and spell resistance as normal, but the save DCs are the same as for a 7th-level spell. For the purpose of other effects that depend on spell level, _wish_ counts as a 9th-level spell.
