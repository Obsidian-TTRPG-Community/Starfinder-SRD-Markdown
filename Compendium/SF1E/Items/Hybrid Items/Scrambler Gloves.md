# Scrambler Gloves

Runes and twisting lines crisscross the shimmering surface of _scrambler gloves_. The gloves count as a worn magic item unless you install them in armor, taking up one upgrade slot.  
  
You can touch a creature with these gloves by attempting a melee attack against your target’s EAC. If you hit, the _scrambler gloves_ disrupt the target’s mental faculties, rendering the victim confused and shaken for 1 round if it succeeds at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half the item level + your key ability score modifier), or for 1d3+1 rounds on a failed save. However, when the creature rolls on the confusion table, a result of 51–75 causes the creature to instead be staggered, and on a result of 76–100, the creature is instead staggered and can’t cast spells or activate supernatural abilities. This is a mind-affecting effect.  
  
After you use the gloves, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to use them again. The gloves’ type determines how many times they can be used per day and how many Resolve Points you can spend for additional activations per day. Once you use a given pair of scrambler gloves, you can’t use a different pair for 24 hours.
