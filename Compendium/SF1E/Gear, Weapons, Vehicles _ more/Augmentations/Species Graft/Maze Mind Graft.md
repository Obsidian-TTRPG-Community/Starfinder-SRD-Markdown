Most nuars have a naturally strong sense of direction Several microchips installed in your brain help you make similar connections, granting you a +2 enhancement bonus to Piloting and Survival checks (as long as you have 1 or more ranks in those skills). In addition, you can attempt a special level-based Wisdom check (1d20 + your level + your Wisdom modifier) instead of using your total bonus in the Piloting skill to navigate or your total bonus in the Survival skill for orienteering.
