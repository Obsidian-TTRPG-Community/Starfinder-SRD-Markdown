# IGNITER

An igniter has a deep-red crystal rod in place of a typical longarm barrel. This crystal focuses infrared light on a distant foe, causing the target to burst into flames. Assassins and drow in particular often favor the weapon due to its absence of any visible discharge. Ember, blaze, inferno, and solar flare igniters are common in many places.

### FLAME WEAPONS

Flame weapons deal fire damage without using lasers or plasma. This flame damage usually comes via superheated metal coils or gas ignition, but weapon manufacturers may devise other methods as well. Flame weapons often have the ability to set targets on fire, dealing burn damage in addition to their initial fire damage when they land especially effective hits.

Most flame weapons rely on a reactive blend of hydrocarbons called petrol for ammunition, rather than batteries.
