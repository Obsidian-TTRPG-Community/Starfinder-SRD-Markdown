# Azata, Tritidair

Flitting among the stars and zipping between worlds, tritidairs resemble violetskinned children with antennae and darkpurple butterfly wings dotted with pinpoints of glowing light. These outsiders are constantly cheerful, frequently playing pranks and making jokes, but their good humor belies a great deal of power. Tritidairs have a deep connection to the nuclear fusion that powers stars, giving them their star-related abilities. Their eyes twinkle with starlight that can fascinate some viewers, so they keep their eyes covered with stylish goggles to prevent accidental exposure. Travelers in starships occasionally spot the unmistakable purple streak of light as a tritidair flies past.

Tritidairs are devoted servants of Desna and frequently travel to Cynosure, the pole star and home of Desna’s palace. Desnan priests say that the goddess planted a seed in a new star, which shot forth light that became the first tritidair. Although this origin story might be apocryphal, what is certain is that the birth of every new star creates a tritidair. They don’t remain near their stars of origin for long, but each tritidair has a unique pattern of glowing dots on their butterfly wings corresponding to the locations of the stars where and when they were born.

These outsiders serve as messengers and pages for the Song of the Spheres, running errands for her throughout the galaxy. Although their starlight form enables interplanar travel, this method of travel has its limits. Tritidairs explain that not every star can provide passage—some are broken—but the concept is difficult to describe to others. Still, tritidairs can move quickly over vast distances to convey messages or provide aid to followers and allies of Desna who find themselves in trouble.

Tritidairs are fiercely loyal. The kindhearted and impulsive creatures don’t seek out combat, nor does Desna commonly send them on missions involving violence. If pushed into combat, particularly if required to protect innocents, they are very willing to use spells and weapons to deal deadly damage. All tritidairs carry easily identifiable starknives patterned with constellations matching those on their wings. These magical starknives charge with energy each time the tritidair travels between stars. Many Desnans carry copies of these knives. Some who have interacted with a tritidair engrave such starknives with constellation patterns matching the wings of that tritidair as a way to honor and remember the azata, much like carving a dear friend’s name on a personal treasure.

These azatas lack sexual characteristics, but some tritidairs choose a gender, and many favor the feminine, mimicking their goddess. They enjoy art, music, and theater, and it’s not uncommon for a major performance to have a tritidair or two in attendance. When tritidairs meet in larger groups, they often enjoy playing games and sports. However, tritidairs don’t have permanent residences or family units, and they don’t stay in one place for long.

Tritidairs sometimes linger on Cynosure or in Elysium, but most prefer to remain on the Material Plane. They genuinely enjoy the company of mortals, and when not on assignments from Desna, tritidairs travel, alone or in small groups, to random planets or starships, where the azatas look for new friends and adventures. Because of this tritidair spirit of exploration, many species on various worlds have myths and stories of flying star children.

Although tritidairs spread the worship of Desna, their primary motivations are to meet new creatures and have fun experiences. They aren’t the most reliable when called upon by anyone but Desna, but nevertheless, some creatures and organizations successfully form alliances with tritidairs. Solarians and tritidairs can feel a connection to one another, given their mutual association with the stars.

Tritidairs don’t age, and some have outlived the birth and death of stars. A tritidair can survive the destruction of its star of origin, and similarly the demise of a tritidair has no discernible effect on the star. Tritidairs also don’t require sleep, but they engage in long meditations to dream. Not only do they find the experience amusing, but Desna can also speak with them through their dreams, sending the tritidairs their missions.

Other creatures sleeping or engaging in similar deep rest near a meditating tritidair can find their dreams invaded by vivid visions from the azatas. Many who have such experiences report that their dreams never go back to normal, remaining rich and dramatic, but seldom troubling. Worshipers of Desna sometimes seek out tritidairs, hoping to earn this experience.

Such seekers also hope to have visions of Desna, such as those who have been blessed with tritidair-influenced dreams have claimed to receive. These assertions can be true—Desna can use the neural pathways a tritidair’s influence opens to communicate with other beings likely to aid the goddess’s aims. Good-hearted dreamers find themselves becoming more spontaneous and venturesome, looking for opportunities to explore and help others. With this increase in boldness comes an increase in apparent luck, although what seems to be luck is just as likely to be an increased awareness of good opportunities and the willingness to seize them.

### Ecology

**Environment** any (Elysium)

### Special Abilities

**Brighten (Su)** As a move action, a tritidair can shed bright light in a 20-foot radius, normal light for an additional 20 feet, and dim light for another 20 feet. The tritidair can shut this light off as a move action, and the light goes out if the azata falls unconscious or dies.

**Light Ray (Su)** A tritidair’s light ray has a range increment of 90 feet. This attack’s damage is good-aligned, so it ignores the energy resistance of evil dragons, evil outsiders, and evil undead.

**Starlight Form (Su)** By focusing and using every action to move for 1 minute, a tritidair can shift its form to starlight—a massless state of pure energy in which the azata can only move and can’t be harmed. While in this form, a tritidair moves at standard navigation and astrogation rates, like a starship, and it uses Mysticism in place of Piloting to astrogate. A tritidair in this form can pass through material objects, provided it begins and ends its turn outside such an object. In addition, a tritidair can enter a star or gas giant and exit another star or gas giant with no restriction on the distance between those bodies. This travel is instantaneous if the tritidair employs it to move within the same system. Otherwise, this travel takes an amount of time equal to Drift travel for the same distance as if the tritidair had a Drift engine rating of 5. A tritidair in starlight form can assume its normal form as a move action, and it resumes its normal form if it somehow falls unconscious or dies.

**Starlight Gaze (Su)** A tritidair’s eyes sparkle with hypnotic starlight. Tritidairs wear special goggles to subdue this gaze, but a tritidair can remove these goggles as a swift action. A creature that fails its save against the gaze is fascinated for 1 round. If a creature succeeds at two saving throws against this effect, the same tritidair’s gaze can’t affect that creature for 24 hours. Azatas are immune to this gaze. This is a mind-affecting effect.
