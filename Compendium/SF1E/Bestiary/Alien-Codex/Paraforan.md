### Special Abilities

**Healing Incandescence (Su)** Once per day as a full action, a paraforan can pulse with a shimmering light that heals it. The paraforan gains fast healing 15 for 1d4+1 rounds. During this time, any creature that begins its turn or moves adjacent to the paraforan must succeed at a DC 21 Reflex save or gain the blinded condition for 1 round. This is a sense-dependent effect.

**Hyperspace Master (Su)** When navigating, a paraforan treats all Drift beacons as frequently visited, even if it has never traveled to that beacon.

**Shrieking Chorus (Su)** Three times per day as a standard action, a paraforan can vibrate its entire body to cause massive psychic pain. Each non-paraforan creature within 60 feet takes 4d8+12 damage and gains the shaken condition for 1d4 rounds. A creature that succeeds at a DC 21 Will save takes half damage, isn’t shaken, and cannot be affected by the same paraforan’s shrieking chorus for 24 hours. This is a mind-affecting effect.
