# Introduction

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 150_  
Nonplayer characters are an essential part of the Starfinder Roleplaying Game, and having a wide suite of pre-built NPCs to choose from can be a boon to any gamemaster. This chapter presents 72 NPCs of varying themes and CR, complete with stat blocks and suggestions for incorporating them into your game. Populate cities and space stations with a variety of compelling NPCs, or flesh out a story for one and have them serve as the PCs’ primary antagonist—use them as you wish!  

# Using the Npc Gallery

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 150_  
There are a number of ways to make use of NPCs.  

## Npcs as Enemies

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 150_  
The most obvious way to use nonplayer characters is in combat encounters. Simply select a stat block (or several) of the appropriate CR and theme, and you’re ready to roll! Even NPCs who seem less combat-oriented (such as celebrities or scholars) can surprise PCs with special abilities, spells, clutch skill checks, and their ability to support other enemy combatants. You can also use these NPCs to help you create skill encounters or other scenarios in which having level-appropriate statistics handy is helpful.  

## Npcs as Allies

You can also use NPCs in combat on the PCs’ side. Note that NPC statistics are best balanced to serve as adversaries against player characters, not against other NPCs. Also keep in mind the PCs should be the stars of most encounters—on top of which, it can also be wearisome for everyone at the table (including the GM) when a prolonged exchange takes place between two or more characters controlled by the same person.  
However, having an NPC ally to provide covering fire, a temporary alternative target for a formidable foe, or a minor (or sometimes major) tactical advantage via a special ability at just the right moment can provide for some great storytelling moments and make the world of your adventures feel that much more authentic.  

## Npcs As... Npcs

One of the least obvious but potentially most rewarding ways to use these NPCs is as inspiration for a recurring nonplayer character you want to introduce to the PCs, whether as a dastardly nemesis who always seems to get away by the skin of their teeth or a reliable fixer who always has a job to offer the PCs. Use any facet of these NPCs’ art, thematic introductions, or special abilities—mixing and matching as you see fit—to inspire your own creations, and you’ll never lack an interesting character for players to meet!  

## Special Abilities

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 151_  
Most of the NPCs presented in this chapter have unique special abilities you can use regardless of any adjustments you make to their CR or species, helping to make NPCs thematic and memorable. You can also use these special abilities across NPCs of the same category, or even one of your own creation.  

# Customizing Npcs

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 151_  
Like any set of NPC statistics in Starfinder, you can customize those presented here. Below are some tips for doing just that.  

## Adjusting Cr

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 151_  
You might want to change an NPC’s CR to present a more appropriate challenge for the level of the adventuring party. In that case, use the tables starting on page 129 in the Alien Archive to note important statistics such as Hit Points, AC, and attack, saving throw, and skill check bonuses.  
Alternatives to adjusting CR include using multiple lower-CR NPCs or giving an NPC only half HP and the shaken condition.  

## Changing Species

An NPC’s species can also grant some special abilities, which are marked with an asterisk (*) so you can easily swap them for a different species’ abilities. Remember to add the new species’ abilities! Rules for these abilities are detailed in the associated species’ section in this book. Other statistics—languages, senses, size, and speeds—might also change, though you can generally adjust these on the fly.  

## Adding Class Grafts

You can also add a class graft to an NPC to further customize their role. The rules for class grafts appear on page 137 of the Alien Archive and the evolutionist class graft appears on page 5 of this book.
