**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 131_  
**Category** Personal Items (Perfume)  
**Level**:: 5**Price** 500

### Description

Pheromonal perfumes have been specially designed to influence members of a specific species; a pheromonal perfume grants you a +2 circumstance bonus to Charisma-based checks against members of that species. A creature with active environmental protections is immune to the effects of pheromonal perfume. The price listed for pheromonal perfume in Table 1â€“31 is for perfumes that can affect species commonly found in the Pact Worlds, such as humans, kasathas, vesk, etc. Perfumes engineered for more exotic species can cost anywhere from two to five times this price and could potentially be unavailable if contact with the species has only recently been established.
