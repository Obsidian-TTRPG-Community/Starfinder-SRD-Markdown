# Phase Detector

### Description

A small circular device that usually resembles a pocket watch, a _phase detector_ can also be a module attached to a personal comm unit. If a creature or object teleports or changes planes, such as by being summoned, within 120 feet of you, the _phase detector_ alerts you to the event and informs you of its distance and direction relative to you. A _phase detector_ doesn’t specify the type of event it detected, and it doesn’t pinpoint the event’s location.
