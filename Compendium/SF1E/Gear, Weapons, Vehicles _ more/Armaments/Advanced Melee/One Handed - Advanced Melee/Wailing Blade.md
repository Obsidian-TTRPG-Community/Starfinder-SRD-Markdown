While it looks like a longsword at a glance, a wailing blade is composed of a series of microtextured plates. When powered, these plates vibrate to generate an array of sonic frequencies at deafening and damaging volumes. A tymbal wailing blade produces only a single audible sound, while a euphonic wailing blade produces multiple pitches concurrently. Strident wailing blades and warbler wailing blades have pitches that vary, the former sounding like a layered chirping and the latter combining trilling notes.

# SONIC WEAPONS

Sonic weapons emit sonar waves at frequencies that are designed to injure or incapacitate enemies. Many of them are termed “low-frequency devices” (LFDs) and “high-frequency devices” (HFDs) based on the frequencies at which they operate and damage foes.
