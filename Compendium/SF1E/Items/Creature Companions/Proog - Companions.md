# PROOG - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 144_  
Proogs are highly active shape- and color-shifting oozes that enjoy mimicking small objects; they’re most commonly bred as novelty pets. Xenobiologists disagree on how the oozes manage to so accurately duplicate details like color and pattern without sight. Proogs tend to imprint on a single larger creature, and while naturally curious, they rarely stray farther from their owner than the range of their blindsight.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Convincing Accessory (Ex)** While your proog companion is in your space and not moving, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Disguise checks if an inanimate object would help your disguise.

**Mimic (Ex)** A proog can look like any solid object of 1 bulk or less that it comes in contact with. It can’t imitate such an item’s function, moving parts, or the like. A creature that closely examines a mimicking proog can determine its true nature with a successful Perception check (DC = 15 + 1-1/2 × the proog’s level).
