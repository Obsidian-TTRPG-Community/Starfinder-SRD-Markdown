You consecrate a site to your deity. The effects of this ritual last for 1 year, and they extend in a 40-foot radius centered on an immobile shrine, altar, or fixture of your deity. While within the area, worshippers of your deity gain a +1 divine bonus to Armor Class, attack rolls, damage rolls, saving throws, and skill checks. If your deity is chaotic, evil, good, or lawful, attacks by your worshippers made from within the area are chaotic-aligned, evil-aligned, good-aligned, or lawful-aligned, respectively.
