### Description

Extreme hoverskates are for advanced enthusiasts of the sport, allowing for more intense maneuvers. They function identically to hoverskates (Starfinder Armory 104), suspending you approximately 1 inch off the ground when worn and activated. However, when you overcharge your extreme hoverskates, the bonus increase to your speed is 30 feet (instead of 20 feet), and you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance and Athletics checks to jump during that move action this stacks with the bonus granted to your Athletics check for your increase in speed.
