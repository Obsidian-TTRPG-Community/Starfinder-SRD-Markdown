# SMUGGLER’S Compartment

This secret compartment hidden within the vehicle can store a relatively small supply of contraband. A Medium vehicle’s smuggler’s compartment can hold 1 bulk of gear, and the compartment’s capacity triples for each vehicle size category larger than Medium (maximum 81 bulk for a Colossal vehicle). A creature must succeed at a Perception check to detect the compartment, or succeed at a Computers check if using sensors to scan the vehicle. The DC of these checks is based on the compartment’s model.
