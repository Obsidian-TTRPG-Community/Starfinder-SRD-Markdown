# Hazard Response Crew

Emergency workers administer medical care, handle hazardous materials, evacuate disaster victims, and provide myriad other services in the wake of tragedy. They can be selfless idealists, exhausted municipal workers, or mercenaries who don’t lift a finger unless they’re under contract. Whatever their motivations, emergency workers are capable, resourceful, and tough, able to work long hours under difficult conditions.

**Emergency Preparedness (Ex)** A hazard response crew can spend 1 Resolve Point as a swift action to change either one type of energy damage dealt by one of their weapons into another energy type, or change their energy resistance to resist a different type of energy.

## Description

Corporations and governments alike maintain hazard response crews, ensuring dedicated personnel can arrive within hours of disaster to clear roads, repair infrastructure, clear debris, and track down victims. Crew gear typically includes tools for cutting apart barriers and extinguishing flames, many of which are easily weaponized in case a crew needs to fend off scavengers, escaped animals, or other threats.
