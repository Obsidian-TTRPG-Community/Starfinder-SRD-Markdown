ABOUT

Vagabonds are drifters who wander from settlement to settlement, picking up odd jobs but rarely letting settling anywhere. Vagabonds serve well as scouts, hunters, traveling peddlers, smugglers, or similar wanderers living on the fringes of society. Vagabonds make good low-level ranged combatants, and this skill can be improved by replacing the Alertness feat with Far Shot, Precise Shot, or Weapon Focus (any firearm). Alternatively, you can replace ranged weapon feats with Power Attack and Toughness to make a vagabond better in melee combat.
