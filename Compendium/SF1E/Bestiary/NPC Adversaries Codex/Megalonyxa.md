The stocky megalonyxa hail from a heavy gravity world. There, they contemplated the stars as a mostly sedentary species, and were able to build a thriving civilization through the use of magic. Spaceflight eluded them, however. As such, when extraplanetary visitors arrived, they found a highly evolved society eager to take to the stars.

A typical megalonyxa stands about 10 feet tall and weighs 500 pounds.
