# THAKASA - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 3 pg. 146_  
Thakasas are close evolutionary relatives of Castrovelâ€™s shotalashus. Long before the Gap, they were the chosen mount of an aerial cavalry, but with the proliferation of flying vehicles, they have become much rarer.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Death Dive (Ex)** If your thakasa companion is flying at the start of your turn, it can take the charge full action using its fly speed, provided that at least 10 feet of its movement is in a downward direction.

**Midair Rescue (Ex)** If you fall off your thakasa companion while at least 30 feet above the ground, it automatically dives to catch you as a reaction, if able. If it catches you, you are mounted but gain the prone condition. You can use the stand up move action to lose the prone condition.
