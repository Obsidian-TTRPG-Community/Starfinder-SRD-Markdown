# Domectic Drone

Robots are commonly used throughout the galaxy to handle repetitive tasks and make some aspects of life more convenient. Domestic drones have a rudimentary AI and only a limited ability to handle unexpected situations, making them useful for little beyond their specifically designated functions. Although the spy drone is a specialized—and in some places, illegal— version of a domestic drone, several other types of domestic drones are common in any large settlement. When activated, each acts as the indicated type of drone of a 1st-level mechanic, and you control it as if you were a 1st-level mechanic (using either an included remote control or a computer with an added control) except it can’t make any attacks and has no weapon mounts, no feats, and no ability to add drone mods beyond those mods specified in its entry. An activated domestic drone can move its speed, but it can otherwise take only the actions specified in its description or granted by its mods. Most domestic drones have a basic model and an elite model both can understand one language (chosen at purchase), and elite models often have additional abilities and greater autonomy. Some mechanics design their personal drones to resemble ordinary domestic drones, which allows their far more adaptable (and sometimes menacing) drones to blend in.
