# Smoke Screen

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 82_
**Price** 8,500  
**Capacity**:: 20; **USAGE** 5/round  
  
When activated as a move action, this modification emits dense fog, smoke, or steam from the rear of the vehicle, enshrouding pursuers in a cloudy haze. While the modification is active, it creates an obscuring cloud that fills an area twice as wide as the vehicle’s space in any space the vehicle leaves. This cloud grants concealment, and the cloud in any space dissipates automatically after 1 round. While its smoke screen is active, the vehicle grants its pilot a +1 circumstance bonus to Piloting checks made to evade or trick. Although this modification can be installed in a water vehicle, it has no effect underwater.
