# STELLAR REVELATIONS

You learn your first stellar revelations (black hole and supernova) at 1st level, and learn an additional revelation at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Stellar revelations require you to have a minimum level, and are organized accordingly. Additionally, each is marked with a symbol that indicates whether it is a graviton revelation or a photon revelation; these symbols appear above.  



 
**Photon Revelation**


**Graviton Revelation**




## 1ST LEVEL

Every solarian gains Black Hole and Supernova at 1st level. Destructive Discharge and Energy Sink require the Electrical Attunement alternate class feature  

###   BLACK HOLE (SU))
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 103_  

When you’re fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, you can pull any number of creatures within 20 feet of you closer. You choose which creatures are affected and which ones aren’t. Each target must succeed at a Fortitude save or be pulled 10 feet toward you. The range of this revelation and the distance pulled increase by 5 feet at 5th level and every 4 levels thereafter. Solid objects do not block this ability, but any creature that runs into a solid object ceases moving closer to you. Creatures moved by this ability do not provoke attacks of opportunity from this movement. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Black hole functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them. 

###   DESTRUCTIVE DISCHARGE (SU))

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 30_  
When you’re fully energy-attuned, as a standard action, you can deal 1d8 electricity damage plus 1d8 per solarian level to one creature within 30 feet of you (Fortitude half). Increase this revelation’s range by 5 feet for every 2 solarian levels you have. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Destructive discharge functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them. 

###   ENERGY SINK (SU))

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 30_  
When you’re fully resistance-attuned, as a standard action, you can cause all creatures within 10 feet of you to become fatigued for 1 minute, and any creature that’s already fatigued becomes nauseated for 1 round (Fortitude negates). Creatures affected by this ability must expend twice as many charges as normal when operating items powered by batteries. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Energy sink functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them. 

###   SUPERNOVA (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 103_  
When you’re fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, you can deal 1d6 fire damage plus 1d6 additional fire damage per solarian level to all creatures within 10 feet of you. A creature that succeeds at a Reflex save takes half damage. At 9th level, you can increase the radius to 15 feet, and at 17th level, you can increase the radius to 20 feet. After you use this revelation, you immediately become unattuned. Supernova functions as a zenith revelation for the purposes of abilities that reference them.

## 2ND LEVEL

You must be 2nd level or higher to choose these stellar revelations.  

###   AGILE WAVELENGTHS (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 85_  
You have developed a technique to conduct maneuvers on the battlefield at range with your solar flare. You can attempt combat maneuvers as a ranged attack instead of a melee attack, with a range of 30 feet. Any weapon special properties your solar flare has that would affect certain combat maneuvers apply as normal. While attuned or fully attuned, you gain a +2 insight bonus to combat maneuvers attempted at range using this stellar revelation. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation. 

###   AWAKENED FLAMES (SU)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 30_  
 As a standard action, you elevate the energy levels in the body of a target creature within 30 feet, causing it to combust if it moves. Until the end of your next turn, the first time the creature moves from its space, it gains the burning condition (Fortitude negates), dealing 1d6 fire damage per round. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 4 levels thereafter. If you’re attuned or fully attuned when you score a critical hit against a creature, you can attempt to use this revelation as a swift action against the creature rather than as a standard action until the end of your next turn. Once you’ve targeted a creature with this revelation, you can’t target it again with awakened flames for 24 hours. 

###   BLADE IN THE NIGHT (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 85_  
You have learned how to damage your foes not just with light, but also with the absence of light. As a move action, you can choose a creature within 30 feet of you. For 1 round, or until you leave graviton mode, you gain a +1 bonus to weapon damage rolls against that creature. This bonus damage increases by 1 at 8th level and every 6 levels thereafter. While attuned or fully attuned, this bonus damage instead increases by 1 at 4th level and every 4 levels thereafter. 

###   CONSTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 152_  
 Forces humming within your solar armor make it more difficult for sound waves and electrical impulses to reach your body and harm you. You gain energy resistance 5 whenever your solar armor is active. You can choose either electricity resistance or sonic resistance when you activate the armor, and you can switch energy types as a move action.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you double the amount of resistance granted by this ability. 

###   DARK MATTER (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
As a move action, you can draw on the properties of dark matter to increase your density, allowing you to resist physical damage. You gain damage reduction 1/—. This increases to DR 2/— at 6th level and increases by 1 again every 3 solarian levels thereafter. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. When you are attuned or fully attuned, your DR from dark matter is equal to half your solarian level. 

###   DARK MATTER SENSES (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Serpents in the Cradle pg. 52_  
Your sensitivity to dark matter allows you to navigate in lightless conditions. You gain darkvision with a range of 60 feet. 

###   DISTANT BURST (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 85_  
 Your solar manifestation is an extension of yourself, and you have learned to center your power outward. Any stellar revelations (including zenith revelations) that have a radius and are centered on you can be centered anywhere within 20 feet of you. While attuned or fully attuned, they can instead be centered anywhere within 40 feet of you. 

###   DISTRACTING GLARE (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 85_  
 Your shimmering power draws your enemies’ focus to the real threat: you. As a move action, you can focus your attention on a creature within 30 feet of you. The target must attempt a Fortitude save. If it fails, it takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls for attacks that don’t include you as a target for 1 round or until you leave photon mode. 

### FLARE (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 As a move action, you can shed light in a 30-foot radius for 1 minute. You choose dim, normal, or bright light each time you activate this revelation. As a standard action, you can create a flash of brilliant light, forcing one creature within 30 feet to succeed at a Reflex save or be blinded for 1 round. Once you’ve targeted a creature with flare, you can’t target it with this revelation again for 10 minutes. Blind or sightless creatures are not affected by this use of this revelation.

When you create a flash of light as a standard action and you are attuned or fully attuned, you can instead choose to make all enemies within range dazzled for 1 round (no save). 

###   GRAVITATIONAL LOCK (SU))

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 30_  
You can bind an enemy to you through gravitational forces. As a move action, choose one creature adjacent to you. Whenever the target attempts to move to any space that isn’t adjacent to you before the beginning of your next turn, it must succeed at a Fortitude save or be unable to move into that space, losing the remainder of the distance it could’ve traveled with that action. Once the target is no longer adjacent to you, the effect ends. While you’re attuned or fully attuned, a target that fails its save also struggles to focus on anyone but you, treating enemies other than you as having concealment. Once a creature has been affected by this revelation, it becomes immune to your gravitational lock for 24 hours. 

###   GRAVITIC REINFORCEMENT (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 85_  
You can shore up your most frustrating weaknesses with balancing gravity. As a move action, you can gain a +1 enhancement bonus to your lowest saving throw for 1 minute, which persists even if you become unattuned, but not if you leave combat or a similar high-stress situation. If multiple saving throws are tied for lowest saving throw, choose one to benefit from this revelation. If you are in graviton mode while benefiting from this revelation, this bonus instead applies to all of your saving throws for as long as you are in graviton mode. This bonus increases by 1 at 8th level, and again every 6 levels thereafter. 

###   GRAVITY ANCHOR (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 As a move action, you can form a gravitational bond between yourself and either the surface you’re standing on or the objects you are holding. This grants you a +4 bonus to your AC against bull rush, reposition, and trip combat maneuvers if you choose the surface underfoot, or against disarm combat maneuvers if you choose objects. The bonus lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. You can have only one gravity anchor active at a time.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can activate this revelation as a reaction when targeted by a bull rush, disarm, reposition, or trip combat maneuver, in which case it defends against only that attack. 

###   GRAVITY BOOST (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 You can increase or reduce the gravitational attraction between yourself and the terrain around you. You can add a bonus equal to one-third your solarian level (minimum +1) to Athletics checks to climb, jump, or swim as part of the action you take to attempt the skill check. In addition, as a reaction when you are falling, you can reduce the falling damage you take by half. At 6th level, you can move along vertical surfaces and even upside down along ceilings for 1 round. This functions as _spider climb_, but it leaves your hands free and you can also run. You must end your movement on a surface that can support you normally. If you end your movement while you are standing on a vertical surface or ceiling, you fall unless you succeed at an Athletics check to climb to remain in position.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the bonus you gain from this revelation to checks to climb, jump, or swim doubles. 

###   GRAVITY GRAPPLER (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
You can shape gravity into translucent coils that you can anchor to objects. As a standard action, you can hurl this coil at a target, functioning in all ways like a grappler with titanium alloy cable line with a maximum range equal to 30 feet multiplied by your Charisma modifier (minimum 1). This cable line lasts for 1 minute or until you use this revelation again. While you are attuned or fully attuned, you gain Grappler Pull as a bonus feat. 

###   GRAVITY HOLD (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 This revelation allows you to move objects at a distance as per _psychokinetic hand_ (see page 370).

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use the _psychokinetic hand_ ability of your gravity hold to immobilize, lift, or move a Medium or smaller creature. The creature can attempt a Fortitude save to negate the effect. While under this effect, the target creature cannot move, but can take any other normal actions. This ability follows all of the restrictions of the spell other than the weight limit, but you can’t lift a creature higher than 5 feet off the ground. When you spend a standard action concentrating to maintain the gravity hold, the target can attempt a new save to end the effect. Once a creature successfully saves against this ability, it becomes immune to further uses of this revelation for 24 hours. 

###   HEAVY LANDING (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 You can redirect the energy of deadly falls into deadlier strikes. You reduce falling damage you take by an amount equal to your solarian level (minimum 0 damage). If you hit a creature using a melee attack within 1 round of reducing your falling damage in this way, your first such successful attack deals additional damage equal to the falling damage this revelation prevented. When you are fully graviton attuned, add your Charisma modifier to the maximum falling damage this revelation can prevent. 

###   LIGHTSPEED TREAD (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 You can travel across great distances with incredible speed. You gain a +10-foot enhancement bonus to each of your speeds when calculating the distance you travel overland, and you grant this bonus to all allies within 50 feet of you. You also increase the full speed and speed in miles per hour of vehicles you pilot by 10%.  
While you are attuned or fully attuned, each of your speeds gains a +10-foot enhancement bonus until the end of your next turn whenever you use a photon stellar revelation. 

###   PERSONAL ORBIT (SU))

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 45_  
 As a move action, you cause your body to act as a carefully controlled gravity well. Unattended objects of bulk L or less within 5 feet of you (as well as up to 3 items of bulk L or less stowed on your body) drift toward you and begin gently orbiting your body. The total bulk of objects orbiting you in this way can’t exceed half your solarian level, and the objects don’t provide you cover, concealment, or similar defensive advantages. You can retrieve any single item currently orbiting you as a swift action. Allies can pick up items orbiting you as if they were unattended, whereas other creatures must succeed at a Reflex save when attempting to grab one of the items. On a failed save, the action fails and is wasted. When you’re fully attuned, you can give one of your orbiting items to an adjacent creature as a swift action.  
This effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier or until you leave graviton mode, whichever occurs first. As a move action, you can sustain the effect, resetting its duration to its maximum. When the effect ends, all orbiting objects immediately drop to the ground in your space. 

###   PLASMA SHEATH (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 As a move action, you can cause all of your melee attacks to deal fire damage instead of their normal damage type. (The attacks are still made against the target’s EAC or KAC as normal for the weapon.) This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, your attacks with plasma sheath deal additional fire damage equal to half your level. 

###   RADIATION (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 As a standard action, you can emit an aura of low-level radiation. Creatures within 5 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save or be sickened. A sickened creature recovers as soon as it moves out of your aura, and a creature that succeeds at its saving throw is immune to your radiation for 24 hours. This is a poison effect (see page 415). The radiation lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the size of your aura increases to 10 feet. 

###   SOLAR BATTERY (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 30_  
 You can energize a battery with solar power, empowering a weapon but draining the battery in the process. As a move action, you supercharge one weapon you’re wielding or a weapon wielded by an ally within your melee reach. The weapon must have a battery, and that battery must have at least half its charges remaining. The next attack made with that weapon before the end of your next turn gains a bonus to its damage equal to your solarian level plus your Charisma modifier, but the attack expends the battery’s remaining charges.  
If you’re attuned or fully attuned, you can cause half or all of the weapon’s damage to become fire damage instead of its normal damage type; this doesn’t change whether the attack targets EAC or KAC. If the attack already deals two types of damage, the wielder can replace one or both of them with fire damage. 

###   STELLAR EQUILIBRIUM (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 152_  
 You can draw energy from your connection to the cosmos to regulate your internal temperature and even your physiology. Also long as your solar armor is active, you can exist comfortably in conditions between –50° and 170° F without needing to attempt Fortitude saves, and you do not need to eat or drink to survive.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you ignore the environmental effects of being in a vacuum and receive a +4 bonus to all saving throws against diseases and poisons. 

###   STELLAR RUSH (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 104_  
 As a standard action, you can wreathe yourself in stellar fire and make a charge without the penalties (see page 248).  
When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can substitute a bull rush for the melee attack at the end of the charge. If you attempt this bull rush, the target takes 2d6 fire damage (Reflex half), regardless of whether you succeed. This damage increases by 1d6 at 6th level and every 2 levels thereafter. 

###   ULTRAVIOLET PULSE (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 You can debilitate your opponents’ defenses with ultraviolet light. As a standard action, you can focus ultraviolet light on a creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature takes a –1 penalty to all saving throws for 1 round, or until you leave photon mode. If you are attuned or fully attuned, all creatures within 10 feet of the target take a –1 penalty to all saving throws for as long as the target is affected by this stellar revelation. If you would become unattuned from using a zenith revelation, the penalty remains until after the zenith revelation is resolved. 

###   UNPREDICTABLE GRAVITY (SU))

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 30_  
 As a standard action, you distort the kinesthesia of a target creature within 30 feet. Until the end of your next turn, the first time the creature moves from its space, it gains the flat-footed condition and treats the first square it enters as difficult terrain each time it uses a move action (Fortitude negates all of these effects). At the end of each of its turns, the target can attempt another Fortitude save, ending the revelation’s ongoing effects. If you’re attuned or fully attuned when you score a critical hit against a creature, you can attempt to use this revelation as a swift action against that creature rather than as a standard action until the end of your next turn. Once you’ve targeted a creature with this revelation, it becomes immune to your unpredictable gravity for 24 hours. 

###   VISIONARY VIEW (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 You’re only in the dark when you decide to be. As a full action, you gain low-light vision and darkvision 60 feet, which last for 10 minutes. The effect ends prematurely after a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier in which you are neither using sidereal influence with photon skills nor have at least 1 attunement point in photon mode. At 10th level, the darkvision granted by this revelation also allows you to see in magical darkness as if it were normal darkness.

## 6TH LEVEL

You must be at least 6th level to choose these stellar revelations.  

###   ASTROLOGIC SENSE (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 You can sense the movement of all objects influencing you to gain insight into upcoming events. Once per day as a full action, you can try to determine whether a particular action of yours will bring good or bad results for you in the immediate future. This functions as augury (see page 340) with your effective caster level equal to your solarian level. You can spend 1 Resolve Point to use this revelation again on the same day, but you still can’t use it more than once per hour.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can see 1 hour into the future (instead of half an hour as is normal for augury) when you use this revelation.

###   ATTACTIVE FORCE (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 152_  
 Your weapon exerts a pull that makes objects cling to it and can even stymie opponents with strands of force. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon, the disarm weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, if you score a critical hit with the weapon, your target must succeed at a Reflex save or be entangled for 1 round. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the entangling effect. 

###   BACK BLAST (SU))

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 31_  
 When you activate your supernova stellar revelation while in an area with an atmosphere, you can choose for the revelation to create intense turbulence in the affected area. Your supernova disperses fog, smoke, and similar effects as though it were strong wind. At the beginning of your next turn, the air implodes toward the area’s center, creating strong winds for 1 round and causing all creatures with the burning condition in the area to immediately take fire damage equal to the damage dealt by their burning condition (Reflex negates the additional damage). 

###   BLAZING ORBIT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a move action, you can move up to your speed, gaining concealment against any attack made against you during the move, and you can leave a trail of flames in every square you pass through. The flames last for 1 round and deal 2d6 fire damage to anyone who moves into them. You can’t move through another creature’s space during this movement. If you use blazing orbit again, any flames you previously created with it go out. The damage from the flames increases by 1d6 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature damaged by the flames also gains the burning condition (1d6 fire damage; see page 273). 

###   CORONA (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a standard action, you can surround your body with an envelope of fiery plasma. You gain cold resistance 10, and any adjacent creature that hits you with a natural weapon or a melee weapon takes 2d6 fire damage. The corona lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode. At 12th level, the damage increases to 3d6 and the cold resistance increases to 15. At 18th level, the damage increases to 4d6 and the cold resistance increases to 20.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, any creature that starts its turn adjacent to you while your corona is in effect takes fire damage equal to half your solarian level. 

###   CRUSH (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a standard action, you can increase the effects of gravity on the internal organs or workings of a target within 30 feet, causing it to have difficulty maintaining its normal functionality. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save or become staggered for 1 round. This revelation also affects constructs. You can maintain this effect as a move action each round, but the target can attempt a new saving throw each round to end the effect. Once a creature succeeds at this save or the effect ends, you can’t target that creature with crush again for 24 hours.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to also stun the target for 1 round. Maintaining crush on subsequent rounds extends the staggered effect, but not the stunned effect. 

###   CRUSHING FORCE (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 Your weapons destroy the tools and energy your foes wield against you. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon, the sunder weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon gains the fatigue critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the fatigue effect. 

###   CURVING FLARE (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 You have developed a technique to use your enemies’ gravity fields against them, creating a shining ricochet. When you make a ranged attack with your solar flare as a standard action and hit, you can use a move action to make a second ranged attack with your solar flare. This second attack is made at a –8 penalty (–6 if you’re attuned or fully attuned) and must be made against a different target than the first attack. You determine line of sight and the range of this attack starting from one corner of the space occupied by the target of the first attack. The second attack is treated as an attack in a full attack for the purposes of abilities that reduce the penalties for full attacks. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation.

###   DEFY GRAVITY (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a move action, you can fly up to your speed. You must end this movement on solid ground or you fall. At 12th level or higher, you don’t have to land if you immediately follow your flight with another move action to use defy gravity. On your last move action of the turn, you still have to land or fall.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, your fly speed from this revelation increases by 10 feet. 

###   DRAINING AGONY (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 You can increase the suffering of those who would oppose you. As a reaction while you’re attuned or fully attuned, when a hostile creature within 30 feet of you takes damage from any source, you can add your solarian level to the total damage the creature takes. Once you use this revelation, you can’t use it again until the next time you rest for 10 minutes to regain Stamina Points. 

###   GAMMA DISTORTION (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 As a full action, you create a 5-, 10-, or 15-foot-radius aura that lasts 10 minutes and deflects incoming radiation. Creatures in the aura treat any radiation to which they’re exposed as being one step less severe (e.g. high radiation levels are treated as medium radiation levels). 

###   GLOW OF LIFE (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to recover a number of Hit Points equal to twice your solarian level. Once you use this revelation, you can’t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, increase the amount you heal with this revelation to three times your solarian level. 

###   GRAVITY PULSE (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 Your solar flare has an intrinsic connection to gravitational forces. As a move action, you can grant your solar flare the gravitation (10 ft.) weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode, whichever comes first. When you are attuned or fully attuned, this gravitation property instead has a value of 20 feet. You must have a solar flare to select this stellar revelation. 

###   GRAVITY SURGE (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a full action, you can perform a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a target within 30 feet. Use your Charisma modifier on your attack roll instead of your Strength modifier, and you gain a +4 bonus to this attack roll that doesn’t stack with the bonus from the Improved Combat Maneuver feat.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, if you disarm a target with gravity surge and have a hand free, the dropped item flies toward you and you can snatch it from the air. If you trip a target with gravity surge, you can pull the target up to 10 feet closer to you. 

###   HUNTER’S GLOOM (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 As a full action, you can warp light around you, creating an area of visual distortion in your space for 10 minutes or until your leave your space. This grants you concealment and a +2 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks, and the bonus increases to +4 when you attempt Stealth checks to snipe.  
If you begin combat while concealed by this ability and while using your sidereal influence ability to augment graviton skills, your sidereal influence doesn’t automatically end; it instead ends during combat only once your hunter’s gloom effect ends. 

###   HYPNOTIC GLOW (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 105_  
 As a standard action, you can convince one living creature that you are to be trusted. This functions as _charm person_ (see page 342), but with a duration of 1 round per solarian level you have. When the effect ends, if you are out of line of sight and the target is not engaged in an activity it wouldn’t have begun without being charmed, the target does not realize it was charmed or has acted unusually unless someone else points it out. You can’t use this revelation again while you currently have a creature charmed via this ability, and once you’ve attempted to charm a creature, whether or not the attempt was successful, you can’t charm the same creature again for 24 hours. Your influence over the creature ends once the duration has expired, and at that time the target likely ceases doing anything you’ve requested of it. At 9th level, hypnotic glow functions as _charm monster_ (see page 342).

When you are attuned or fully attuned and you successfully charm a creature using this ability, you can also command it to approach, flee, or halt on its next turn, as per the _command_ spell (no save; see page 343). 

###   IMPLOSION SHOCK (SU))

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 31_  
 At the beginning of your next turn after using black hole, as long as you’re in the revelation’s affected area, you can unleash a devastating shockwave that affects all creatures within 5 feet of you. Creatures in the shockwave take 1d8 force damage and are flat-footed until the beginning of your next turn (Fortitude negates). The damage increases by 1d8 at 8th level and every 2 levels thereafter. 

###   LUMINESCENT INQUISITION (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 Your light shines upon your enemies and reveals the truth. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon or unarmed attacks, the aurora weapon special property. This benefit lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode, whichever comes first. When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon also gains the demoralize critical hit effect in addition to its normal critical hit effect. 

###   PHOTON CIRCUITS (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 31_  
 By creating a complex web of energy inside a computer, you can override its programming. You can use Mysticism to perform the following tasks normally performed with the Computers skill: access unsecured system, detect fake shell, disable or manipulate module, gain root access, and hack system. 

###   PLANAR PENUMBRA (SU))

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 45_  
 You channel extraplanar energies that emulate a black hole’s crushing, draining power. As a move action, you cause a weapon you wield to deal cold damage instead of its usual damage type. (This doesn’t change whether the weapon targets EAC or KAC). The weapon ignores the cold resistance of chaotic outsiders and good outsiders, and it deals an additional 1d6 damage against such creatures. This effect lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. You can’t use this stellar revelation to enhance a weapon that has the anarchic or holy fusion.  
When you’re attuned or fully attuned, your weapon also gains your choice of the axiomatic or unholy fusion for the duration of the effect. This temporary fusion ignores item level requirements and doesn’t count toward the maximum level of fusions the weapon can have at once. 

###   PLANAR RADIANCE (SU))

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 45_  
 You have learned to channel extraplanar energies that emulate a star’s roiling warmth and symbolic benevolence. As a move action, you cause a weapon you wield to deal fire damage instead of its usual damage type. (This doesn’t change whether the weapon targets EAC or KAC). The weapon ignores the fire resistance of evil outsiders and lawful outsiders, and it deals an additional 1d6 damage against such creatures. This effect lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode. You can’t use this stellar revelation to enhance a weapon that has the axiomatic or unholy fusion.  
When you’re attuned or fully attuned, your weapon also gains your choice of the anarchic or holy fusion for the duration of the effect. This temporary fusion ignores item level requirements and doesn’t count toward the maximum level of fusions the weapon can have at once. 

###   REFLECTION (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 106_  
 You can reflect ranged attacks back at your enemies. If you took the total defense action on your last turn, or if you were fighting defensively and spend 1 Resolve Point, as a reaction you can redirect a ranged attack that misses you. Select a new target within 30 feet and make a ranged attack roll with a –4 penalty. If your attack hits, the new target is damaged as if it had been the intended target of the original ranged attack.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you don’t take a –4 penalty to your redirected attack roll. 

###   SHINING SURVIVAL (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 As a full action, you create a mobile shelter that surrounds you in a 5-foot aura, protecting you within a faint, star-studded bubble of energy. While in the shelter, creatures double the bonus to Fortitude saving throws to resist severe weather granted by the Survival skill, and they gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Survival checks to avoid becoming lost. The shelter does not impede creatures’ movement or attacks. The shelter lasts for 8 hours or until you either are no longer benefiting from sidereal influence for photon skills or move more than 60 feet in one round. 

###   SUBDUING BEAMS (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 152_  
 While the sun can sear and burn, it also represents a gentler force of growth and redemption. As a move action, you can grant a weapon you wield, including your solar weapon, the nonlethal weapon special property by sheathing it in a field of cushioning energy. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon gains the staggered critical hit effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the staggered effect. 

###   VITAL REINFORCEMENT (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 You have learned how to use photonic power to bolster your allies in the face of danger. As a reaction while you’re attuned or fully attuned, when an ally other than yourself within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can reduce the damage taken by your solarian level (minimum 0 damage). Once you use this revelation, you can’t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest. 

###   WARP PERCEPTION (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 24_  
 You bend light and minds alike to see what you want them to see. When you finish meditating to activate your sidereal influence for graviton skills, you can simultaneously attempt a Disguise check to change your appearance without using an action. Reduce the check’s DC modifier based on the features modified by an amount equal to half your level (to a minimum of +0). The disguise lasts for up to 12 hours. However, this effect ends prematurely after a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier in which you are neither using sidereal influence with graviton skills nor have at least 1 attunement point in graviton mode.  
You must have selected Disguise as a one of your sidereal influence skills to choose this revelation. 

###   WEAPON ORBIT (SU))

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 31_  
 As a standard action, make a ranged attack with a melee weapon you’re wielding against a target within 30 feet. If you hit, you add your Charisma modifier to the weapon’s damage instead of adding your Strength modifier. At the end of your turn, the weapon returns to your hand unless you don’t have a free hand, in which case the weapon lands in your square. If attuned or fully attuned, you can use this ability to perform a full attack with the melee weapon at range, but each attack must be made against a different target within range. These attacks can benefit from the flashing strikes class feature as though they were melee attacks.

## 10TH LEVEL

You must be at least 10th level to choose these stellar revelations.  

###   BURN ENCHANTMENT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 152_  
 Your attacks’ cosmic energy shreds the magical forces wielded by spellcasters. As a move action, you sheathe your body in protective energy that attunes to spellcasters you strike. If the next successful melee attack you make before the beginning of your next turn hits a creature capable of casting spells or using spell-like abilities, you gain a +2 enhancement bonus to saving throws against that reature’s spells and spell-like abilities for 1 round.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, your weapon gains the dispelling critical effect. If the weapon already has a critical hit effect, when you score a critical hit, you can apply either the weapon’s normal critical hit effect or the dispelling effect. A target affected by the dispelling critical hit effect is the subject of a targeted _dispel magic_, per the spell, using your solarian level as the caster level.

###   DEBRIS FIELD (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 152_  
 As a standard action, you can cause a cloud of debris, microscopic particles, and small items to orbit you, trapped in your personal gravitational field. This grants you concealment against ranged attacks. This ability functions for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the cloud of debris and microscopic particles thickens, increasing the miss chance from your concealment to 50% on ranged attacks (though you are not considered to have total concealment). 

###   FORCEFUL SHIELD (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 Your solar shield, when imbued with photonic energy, can be used for offense as well as defense. As a full action while holding your solar shield, you can make one melee attack with it, dealing damage as if it were a solar weapon (using your solarian level). You can also use it to make an attack of opportunity if a foe provokes one from you before the beginning of your next turn after you used your solar shield in this way. While attuned or fully attuned, you can align your solar shield against the target of your attack as part of the same full action. If you have a _solarian weapon crystal_ inserted in your solar shield, you apply its benefits to these melee attacks. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation. 

###   GLOWING INFLUENCE (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 25_  
 Your influence over light and heat is more adept than most. When you are using sidereal influence with photon skills, you roll 1d8 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check, rather than rolling 1d6. In addition, you choose one additional skill from the photon skill list that you can modify using your sidereal influence ability. 

###   GRAVITY WELL (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 You have learned how to use your solar manifestation to disrupt the gravitational fields around your enemies. As a full action while attuned or fully attuned, you can make an attack with your solar flare, solar shield, or solar weapon against a single target. If you are able to make this attack as a ranged attack, the target must be within 30 feet. On a hit, the area within a 10-foot radius of your target (including the air) becomes difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to half your solarian level. 

###   GROUNDING SINK (SU))

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 31_  
 When you use the energy sink stellar revelation, you draw strength from those around you. If at least one creature fails the Fortitude save against your energy sink, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your solarian level that last for 1 minute. Upon gaining these temporary Hit Points, if you have the fatigued condition, you remove that condition. If you have the exhausted condition, you become fatigued instead. You must have the energy sink stellar revelation to select this revelation. 

###   PARALYZING STORM (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 31_  
 Your electrical discharges overwhelm your target’s motor functions. If the target of your destructive discharge stellar revelation fails its saving throw against the effect, the revelation also has one of the following effects: the target is knocked prone, the target gains the flat-footed condition for 1 round, or the target must succeed at a second Fortitude save or be stunned for 1 round. You must have the destructive discharge stellar revelation to select this revelation. 

###   SOLAR INFERNO (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 86_  
 You have learned how to create a burst of cosmic energy at the point of your solar manifestation’s impact. As a full action while attuned or fully attuned, you can make an attack with your solar flare, solar shield, or solar weapon against a single target. If you are able to make this attack as a ranged attack, the target must be within 30 feet. On a hit, the target and each creature within 10 feet of it except you must attempt a Reflex save. A creature that fails its save gains the burning condition. This burning condition deals 2d6 damage (increasing by 1d6 at 14th level and again at 18th level). 

###   SOUL FURNACE (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 106_  
 You can stoke the internal energy of your entire physiology, allowing you to boost your life processes. As a move action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point. If you are suffering from an affliction (a curse, disease, drug or poison), you can immediately attempt an additional saving throw at the affliction’s normal save DC. If you succeed at this saving throw, the affliction ends (regardless of how many successful saving throws it normally takes to end the affliction). Once you have used this revelation, you can’t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can also use this revelation to end any one of the following conditions you have: bleeding, blinded, burning, cowering, dazzled, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, panicked, shaken, or sickened. 

###   STALWART SHIELD (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 Your solar shield can imitate the cosmic properties of solar armor, especially when you are properly attuned. As a move action while holding your solar shield, you can gain resistance 5 to cold and fire, which increases by another 5 at 20th level. This resistance lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode, whichever comes first. While attuned or fully attuned, if you use a move action to align your solar shield against a specific target, you increase this resistance by 5 against the abilities and attacks of that target. If you have any items that would specifically benefit solar armor, they apply their benefits to your solar shield while this revelation is active. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation. 

###   STEALTH WARP (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 106_  
 You can bend light, sound, and even vibrations around your body, making you harder to notice. As a move action, you can grant yourself a +4 bonus to Stealth checks. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you can use this revelation to reduce your sensory output so much that you can attempt a Stealth check even when you’re directly observed and lack cover or a distraction. You are not invisible, simply difficult to see clearly, and if a creature was observing you prior to your Stealth check, it remains aware of your location until you successfully reach cover or concealment. Your stealth warp ends if you make an attack or cause another creature to attempt a saving throw, or at the beginning of your next turn unless you immediately take another move action to use this revelation. 

###   VIVACIOUS NIMBUS (SU)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 45_  
 As a standard action while shedding normal or bright light with your flare revelation, you can infuse the light with the Positive Energy Plane’s life-giving influence, granting creatures in the illuminated area the effects of the death ward spell. This additional effect lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode, whichever happens first, though you can maintain this effect as a standard action each round (or as a move action if you’re fully attuned). When you blind an undead creature with your flare revelation flash of brilliant light, the target also takes force damage equal to your solarian level.  
You must have the flare revelation to select this revelation. 

###   WEIGHTY INFLUENCE (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 25_  
 Your influence over gravity and attraction is more adept than most. When you are using sidereal influence with graviton skills, you roll 1d8 and add the result as an insight bonus to your check, rather than rolling 1d6. In addition, you choose one additional skill from the graviton skill list that you can modify using your sidereal influence ability.

## 14TH LEVEL

You must be at least 14th level to choose these stellar revelations.  

###   BINARY SHIELD SYSTEM (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 Your bond with your solar shield is strong enough that you can split your focus against multiple foes. When you are fully attuned and use a move action to align your solar shield against a specific target, you can choose a second creature to align your shield against, gaining the full benefits of aligning your shield against both of them. Both creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you align your solar shield against them. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation. 

###   CELESTIAL AEGIS (SU)

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 45_  
 As a move action, you channel the Positive Energy Plane’s power directly into your solar armor or solar shield, helping you capture and redirect your escaping life energy to bolster your body. As a reaction when you take damage that causes you to lose at least 2 Hit Points, you gain temporary Hit Points equal to half the number of Hit Points you lost from the attack or effect. These temporary Hit Points last 3 rounds.  
If you’re attuned or fully attuned, you also gain spell resistance equal to 11 + your solarian level against necromancy spells, and against spells with the cold, darkness, or death descriptors. 

###   GALLANT REBUTTAL (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 Your solar shield aligns with your cosmic potency to such an extent that you can retaliate with a starry burst against those who seek to harm you. As a reaction when you are attuned or fully attuned and take damage from a creature your solar shield is aligned against, you can cause that creature to take fire damage equal to your Charisma bonus. You must have a solar shield to select this revelation. 

###   GRAVITY SHIELD (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 106_  
 As a move action, you can create a minor shield of compressed gravity waves, granting you a +1 circumstance bonus to your AC. The shield lasts for 1 round or until you leave graviton mode.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, as a move action, you can create a disk of massive gravitational energies that is capable of deflecting incoming attacks. Choose one edge of your space. The shield extends along three continuous edges in a straight line centered on the chosen edge. The shield provides cover against attacks coming from its far side, but not against attacks originating from the side you’re on. If you move, you can reposition your shield as part of your move action, moving it to a different edge of your space. You must use one of your hands to direct and maintain an active gravity shield. You cannot use this version of the gravity shield at the same time you use this revelation to gain a circumstance bonus to your AC. This gravity shield also lasts 1 round or until you leave graviton mode. 

###   IMPOSSIBLE GRAVITY (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 25_  
 When you are attuned, you increase the maximum creature size that you can immobilize, lift, or move with the _psychokinetic hand_ ability of your gravity hold revelation to Large creatures. When you are fully attuned, the revelation can also affect Huge creatures.  
When used to move or manipulate objects, the range of your psychokinetic hand ability increases to 100 feet. The maximum weight of the affected object increases to 10 pounds or 1 bulk per solarian level you have. While you are attuned, the maximum weight you can affect doubles. While you are fully attuned, the maximum weight instead quintuples, and you can move the object up to 30 feet as a move action. You must have the gravity hold revelation to choose this revelation. 

###   ORBITAL AWARENESS (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 25_  
 The stars themselves serve as your eyes, though you can project your senses even in their absence. As a full action, choose a 5-foot square that is within 30 feet and to which you have line of sight. For up to 10 minutes while you are within 30 feet of that square, you can perceive as though you were in the selected space. The effect ends prematurely after a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier in which you are neither using sidereal influence with photon skills nor have at least 1 attunement point in photon mode.  
While you are outside, the effect’s range increases to 300 feet so long as you and the selected square both have a clear view of the sky or space. Under these circumstances, you can’t be flanked while this ability is active, and you can perceive from the selected square as though you had darkvision with a range of 120 feet. 

###   PARTICLE FIELD (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 153_  
 As a move action, you surround yourself with a swirling sheath of charged particles that absorb some damage from attacks made against you. This constantly renewing field of particles acts as a force field that grants 25 temporary Hit Points and has fast healing 4. This lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode. This force field does not function if you also have a force field from an armor upgrade, mechanic’s energy shield, or another similar effect.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the fast healing of your particle field increases to 6. 

###   SOLAR FORTIFICATION (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 153_  
 Gravitational anomalies ripple through your solar armor, providing unexpected protection against devastating hits. As long as your solar armor is active, you gain a 20% chance that a critical hit against you is treated as a normal attack, dealing normal damage and not applying any critical effect. You roll this percentage chance before the critical hit damage is rolled. You must have solar armor to select this revelation.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, the chance that a critical hit against you is treated as a normal attack increases to 40%. 

###   SUNBOLT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 106_  
 As a standard action, you can fire a bolt of concentrated solar energy at one target within long range (400 feet + 40 feet per solarian level you have) as a ranged attack targeting the foe’s EAC. If you hit, you deal 9d6 fire damage. If you have a solarian crystal (see Solarian Weapon Crystals on page 170) that changes the type of damage dealt by a solar weapon, you can use it to change the type of damage you deal with your sunbolt. Once you have used this revelation, you can’t use it again until the next time you regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest.

When you are attuned or fully attuned, you gain a +2 bonus to your ranged attack roll to use this revelation. 

###   TENEBROUS BULWARK (SU))

**Source** _Drift Crisis pg. 45_  
 As a move action, you channel the Negative Energy Plane’s power directly into your solar flare or solar weapon, helping you capture and convert your escaping life energy into deadly force. As a reaction when you take damage that causes you to lose at least 2 Hit Points, the next successful attack you make with your solar flare or solar weapon before the end of your next turn deals additional cold damage equal to half the number of Hit Points you lost. Undead creatures are immune to this additional cold damage.  
If you’re attuned or fully attuned, whenever you use this revelation’s reaction to add cold damage to your next attack, your solar flare or solar weapon also gains the penetrating weapon special property until the end of your next turn.

## 16TH LEVEL

You must be at least 16th level to choose these stellar revelations.  

###   ADAPTIVE GRAVITON (SU))

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 25_  
 Choose three graviton revelations that you don’t have. When you become fully graviton attuned, you gain one of these revelations of your choice until you are no longer fully graviton attuned. Temporarily gaining this revelation doesn’t count against your total number of photon and graviton revelations for the purpose of tracking disproportionate revelations. Whenever you gain a level, you can change one of the chosen revelations. 

###   ADAPTIVE PHOTON (SU)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 25_  
 Choose three photon revelations that you don’t have. When you become fully photon attuned, you gain one of these revelations of your choice until you are no longer fully photon attuned. Temporarily gaining this revelation doesn’t count against your total number of photon and graviton revelations for the purpose of tracking disproportionate revelations. Whenever you gain a level, you can change one of the chosen revelations. 

###   SUPERLATIVE CONSTELLATION (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 Your mastery of photonic energy has developed to such an extent that it flows from you in elegant, rapid patterns. Any photon revelation you have that can be used only once before taking a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina Points can now be used up to three times before taking such a rest. 

###   SUPERLATIVE NEBULA (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 Your mastery of gravity gives you the ability to flow through combat with ease. Whenever you use a graviton revelation as a move action or standard action, you can take a guarded step as part of the same action. Additionally, when you take Hit Point damage, as a reaction you can use any graviton revelation you have that can be used as a move action. Once you have used a graviton revelation as a reaction with this ability, you can’t do so again until you take a 10-minute rest to regain Stamina. 

###   ULTIMATE GRAVITON (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 106_  
 As your ability to manipulate powers of gravity expands, the range of any graviton revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a range doubles. Any graviton revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have that targets a single creature can now simultaneously target two creatures, who must be within 20 feet of each other. You also increase the power of any of the following gravity revelations you have.

**Defy Gravity**: Your fly speed increases by 20 feet.  
**Gravity Anchor**: As a move action, you can gain both types of gravity anchor simultaneously.  
**Gravity Boost**: Your bonus applies to all Acrobatics checks, and you take no damage from any fall.  
**Reflection**: If you successfully redirect an attack as a reaction, you can continue to reflect additional attacks until the beginning of your next turn. You have a cumulative –2 penalty to your redirect attack roll on each reflection attempt after the first. If any reflected attack misses, you can’t make further redirect attempts until you use this revelation again.

The Following were added in Galactic Magic.  
**Crushing Force:** Sunder combat maneuvers you perform with the affected weapon gain a +2 bonus to their attack roll.  
**Draining Agony:** Until the end of your next turn, the creature damaged by this revelation takes additional damage from your attacks equal to your Charisma modifier.  
**Gravity Pulse:** Increase the distance this revelation’s gravitation effect can move a target by 5 feet.  
**Gravity Well:** The area of difficult terrain created by this revelation increases to 15 feet for 1 round, after which it’s reduced to 10 feet for the remainder of the effect.  
**Implosion Shock:** You gain a +1 bonus to your AC until the beginning of your next turn.  
**Stalwart Shield:** Adjacent allies also gain the resistance to cold and fire provided by this revelation. 

###   ULTIMATE PHOTON (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 Your ability to manipulate powers of light and energy expand greatly. The radius of any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) you have with a radius expands by 10 feet. Any photon revelation (but not zenith revelation) that lasts for 1 round or until you leave photon mode now lasts for 1d4 rounds if you are not in photon mode. You also increase the power of any of the following photon revelations you have.

**Astrologic Sense**: You can see twice as far into the future as normal.  
**Glow of Life**: You can use this revelation as a swift action, rather than a move action.  
**Hypnotic Glow**: The charm’s duration doubles.  
**Stellar Rush**: You gain a +2 bonus to your EAC until the beginning of your next turn.

The following were added in Galactic Magic.  
**Awakened Flames\*:** When rolling damage for this revelation’s burning condition, you treat any damage die with a result of 1 as though it were a 6.  
**Back Blast:** Creatures that fail their Reflex save against this revelation are also buffeted by the winds, becoming flatfooted until the end of your next turn.  
**Curving Flare:** The second ranged attack made with this revelation is made at only a –6 penalty (or –4 if you’re attuned or fully attuned).  
**Distant Burst:** The revelation’s range increases to 30 feet, or 60 feet when you’re attuned or fully attuned.  
**Forceful Shield:** Once per minute as part of this revelation’s full action, you can take a guarded step toward the target of your solar shield attack.  
**Solar Inferno:** Increase the damage dealt by this revelation’s burning condition by an amount equal to your Charisma modifier.  
**Vital Reinforcement:** The first time the affected ally regains Hit Points or Stamina Points before the end of your next turn after using this revelation, increase either the Hit Points or Stamina Points regained by half your solarian level.

## ZENITH REVELATIONS

You can choose these stellar revelations only when you gain the zenith revelations class feature.  

###   CONSTELLATION BLAST (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 When you’re fully photon-attuned, as a standard action, you can create a momentary chain of bursting energy that burns through the terrain. When you use this ability, you create three 10-foot-radius bursts within 60 feet of you, each of which cannot overlap and must be centered no more than 20 feet from the center of one other radius. You deal 5d6 fire damage, plus 1d6 for every 2 solarian levels you have beyond 9th, to each creature in each radius. An affected creature can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage. At 17th level, you can create three, four, or five bursts when using this ability.

###   FEAR HORIZON (SU))

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 31_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can leverage cosmic gravity as a standard action to drain enemies’ hope. All enemies in a 30-foot emanation with a CR equal to or less than your level become frightened for 1 minute (Will negates). At the end of each of its turns, an affected creature can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect prematurely. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. 

###   GRAVITIC CALLING (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can call creatures of intense gravity to fight for you as a standard action. This functions as _summon creature_ with a spell level equal to one-third your solarian level. You select which four creatures you can summon each time you gain a solarian level, and they must all be shadow creatures. Creatures you summon with this ability gain the Coordinated Shot feat. 

###   MINIATURE STAR (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 When you’re fully photon-attuned, you can create a simulacrum of a star as a standard action. The star is a 10-foot-radius sphere that fills your square (or one square of your space, if you’re larger than Medium) and all squares within 5 feet of that space. Any creature that starts its turn in the same space as the star takes 1d6 fire damage for every 2 solarian levels you have, and any creature that starts its turn outside the star but within 5 feet of it takes half that damage. At 17th level, you can create your star simulacrum as a 15-foot-radius sphere that affects your square and all squares within 10 feet of that space (a total of 21 squares).

Creatures can move through the star, but it exerts a gravitational pull, and any creature inside it or within 5 feet of it must spend twice as much movement for each square of movement that takes it away from the center of the star. The star remains for 1d4+1 rounds, and stays in place even if you later move. You are immune to all effects of your own miniature star. 

###   NEBULA STORM (SU))

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, as a standard action, you can create areas of cosmic energy that make it difficult to maneuver. When you use this ability, you create three 10-foot-radius bursts within 60 feet of you, each of which cannot overlap and must be centered no more than 20 feet from the center of one other radius. These areas become difficult terrain for a number of rounds equal to your solarian level, and any creature that starts their turn within this difficult terrain takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage, plus 1d6 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 9th. An affected creature can attempt a Fortitude save to take half damage. At 17th level, you can create three, four, or five bursts when using this ability.

### PARTICLE WAVE (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 153_  
 When you’re fully photon-attuned, you can dissolve into a Large cloud composed of thousands of flaming pinpoints of brilliance as a standard action. While in this form, you gain a swarm attack that deals 4d6 fire damage, swarm defenses, swarm immunities (_Starfinder Alien Archive_ 157), and a fly speed equal to your land speed. You lose all normal modes of attack and movement, all abilities that depend on your physical form, and any bonus to your KAC and EAC granted by your armor. You can maintain this form for a number of rounds equal to your solarian level. Returning to your normal form before the duration expires requires a standard action. The damage of your swarm attack increases by 1d6 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 7th. At 17th level, targets damaged by your swarm attack must succeed at a Reflex saving throw or be blinded for 1 round.

### PULSAR SPIN (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Serpents in the Cradle pg. 52_  
 You can imitate the glory of a spinning pulsar. When you are fully photon-attuned, you can make a sudden spin as a standard action, emitting high-energy particles in a 120-foot line centered on you and extending 60 feet in either direction. Creatures in the affected squares other than you are exposed to low radiation. When you reach 6th level, creatures within your pulsar spin are exposed to medium radiation instead; at 12th level, they’re exposed to high radiation, and at 20th level, they’re exposed to extreme radiation.  
In addition, when you use this power, any creature within 10 feet of you must succeed at a Fortitude save or be rendered off-target and flat-footed for 1 round by the tumultuous magnetic waves. 

###   QUANTUM ENTRAPMENT (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 153_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can pull a creature outside the normal confines of space and time. To use this ability, you must succeed at a melee attack against the target’s EAC. If you hit the target, it must succeed at a Will saving throw or be shunted out of reality for 1d4 rounds. The creature is in an extradimensional space that causes it no harm, but it effectively ceases to exist and it cannot be located or contacted by any mundane or magical means. When the duration expires, the creature reappears in the space it last occupied, or in the closest unoccupied space if its original space is now occupied. To the target creature, it seems as if no time has passed during its absence, and it returns exactly in the state it was when it disappeared, including having the same duration remaining on any spells or effects that were affecting it at the time of its departure. At 17th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction when you hit a creature with this ability to increase its duration to a number of rounds equal to half your solarian level. 

###   RAY OF LIGHT (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 When you’re fully photon-attuned, as a move action, you can transform yourself into a ray of light and move at light speed to any space you can see within long range. Any barrier that would block, reflect, or scatter light prevents you from moving through it. No creature can use a reaction to interfere with your movement or make attacks of opportunity against you unless it’s capable of reacting faster than the speed of light. At 17th level, you can touch one willing or unconscious creature to convert it to light and bring it with you as part of the same action. 

###   SOLAR ACCELERATION (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 When you’re fully photon-attuned, you can make a full attack as a standard action. In addition, you and up to six allies within 30 feet are affected by _haste_ (see page 358) for 1 minute after you use this revelation. At 17th level, the extra speed from the _haste_ effect increases to 60 feet (to a maximum of three times the creature’s normal speed). 

###   SOLAR INCURSION (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 87_  
 When you’re fully photon-attuned, you can invite creatures of fiery power to fight for you as a standard action. This functions as _summon creature_ with a spell level equal to one-third your solarian level. You select which four creatures you can summon each time you gain a solarian level, and they must all be fire creatures. The natural attacks of creatures you summon with this ability have the _limning_ weapon fusion. 

###   STARQUAKE (SU))

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can create a violent ripple of movement to knock down your foes. As a move action, you can move up to your speed along the ground without provoking attacks of opportunity. Each creature you are adjacent to at any point during that movement takes 1d8 bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Reflex save or be knocked prone. The affected creatures don’t need to be standing on solid ground to fall prone, and any that were in the air (but still adjacent to you) fall to the ground on a failed save. The damage increases by 1d8 for every 3 solarian levels you have beyond 7th. At 17th level, you can move up to twice your speed along the ground with this revelation. 

###   STELLAR REBIRTH (SU)

**Source** _Tech Revolution pg. 31_  
 As a standard action when you’re fully photon-attuned, you can heal a creature you touch that has been dead for no more than 2 rounds. The creature is restored to life with 1 Hit Point and has 1 negative level for 24 hours. This ability has no effect on creatures slain by death effects, creatures turned into undead, or creatures whose bodies were significantly mutilated. 

###   TIME DILATION (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can make time pass more slowly for your enemies. As a standard action, you can project a gravitational wave in a 30-foot cone. You choose which creatures in the cone are affected and which ones aren’t. Each target must succeed at a Fortitude save or by affected by _slow_ (see page 377) for a number of rounds equal to your solarian level. At 17th level, even targets that succeed at their saving throws are affected by slow for 1 round. 

###   WORMHOLES (SU)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 107_  
 When you’re fully graviton-attuned, you can create two linked wormholes as a standard action. One wormhole must be adjacent to you, and the other appears anywhere in line of sight within medium range (100 feet + 10 feet per solarian level). Each wormhole is 5 feet across and appears at an intersection between two squares. You and any Large or smaller creatures you mentally designate (you can designate “all creatures,” “all lashuntas,” or similar categories) can travel between the wormholes. This is considered extradimensional travel. Entering a wormhole instantly transports a creature to a square adjacent to the other wormhole’s intersection, where the creature can continue its movement. The wormholes remain for 1 round for every 2 solarian levels you have. At 17th level, you can create three wormholes using this ability, and upon entering the wormhole, a creature can decide which of the other two wormholes to exit.
