### DESCRIPTION

This single-use clear mask, configurable to a wide range of species, can be found in safety kits throughout the galaxy. Whether it burns specialized salts or employs canisters of compressed gas, an enviro mask protects you from suffocation and inhaled hazards for 1 hour. It doesn’t protect from other effects of vacuum or decompression, and it grants no benefit after 1 hour.
