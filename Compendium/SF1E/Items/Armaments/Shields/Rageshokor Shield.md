# Rageshokor Shield

**Source**:: _Alien Archive 4 pg. 97_  
Vesk have used rageshkor frill plates for shields since ancient times. In the post-Gap era, vesk have developed high-tech versions of these shields that incorporate synthetic padding, alloyed fittings, and more to augment the natural materials while maintaining the shieldsâ€™ cultural value. Although these shields can be purchased, a carrier in vesk territory should expect to be asked whether the shield was truly won (harvested from a rageshkor the wielder defeated), where the clash occurred, and how the battle fared. An earned rageshkor shield is a prestige piece that can win a warrior much respect.
