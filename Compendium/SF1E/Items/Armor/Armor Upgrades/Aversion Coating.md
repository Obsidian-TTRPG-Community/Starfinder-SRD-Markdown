This small module secretes a terrible-tasting chemical compound. The aversion coating grants you gain a +2 bonus to AC against bite attacks. If you are subject to the swallow whole universal creature rule, the swallowing creature must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 15 + the armor’s level) or become nauseated for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the creature is sickened for 1d6 rounds instead.
