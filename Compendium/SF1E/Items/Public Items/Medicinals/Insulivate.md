As an extension of their supernatural healing abilities, agathions have developed specialized medicines infused with the holy properties of Nirvana. These enlightened medicinals follow the rules for medicinals in the Starfinder Core Rulebook, though they’re hybrid items that use Life Science or Mysticism as the associated skills for crafting.

An insulivate moderates electrical impulses, channeling excess energy safely out of the body. When you take or are injected with an insulivate, you gain a bonus to saving throws against effects with the electricity descriptor as well as effects that deal electricity damage. In addition, you gain a bonus to your EAC against attacks that deal electricity damage. Both bonuses are equal to the medicinal’s tier, and the medicinal’s effects last for a number of minutes equal to 10 times the medicinal’s tier.
