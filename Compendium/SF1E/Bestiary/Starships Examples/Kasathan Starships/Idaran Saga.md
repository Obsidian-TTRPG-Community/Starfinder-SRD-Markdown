## Description

Upon arriving in the Pact Worlds, the kasathas of the Idari realized that the small, aging escort fleet that had ushered the colony ship from their home world was outclassed and outgunned by their new neighbors’ starships. Developed as a cornerstone of this new navy, the Saga is a versatile battle cruiser that has played a critical role in maintaining kasathan interests and supplementing Steward forces in times of war.  
  
The Saga incorporates a combination of Pact Worlds technology and proprietary Idari Crucible Works energy-to-matter construction techniques. The starships are as much defenders as they are visual statements of kasathan aesthetics. Not only does a Saga display the iconic curving silhouette of other kasathan starships, but many of its core sections interlock with magnetic field locks, allowing elements to detach, reconfigure, and even float in parallel alongside the starship’s main body. The largest of these components rest along the Saga’s port and starboard sides, detaching during confrontations and spreading into menacing, metallic wings. In addition to their intimidation factor, the wings are also weapons platforms, each equipped with a host of torpedoes and an edge that helps channel the Saga’s electromagnetic countermeasures to foil enemy sensors and targeting systems. Finally, the wings conceal the starship’s armored shuttle bays.  
  
A Saga starship on patrol typically carries two Keris or Thunderbolt starships within its twin shuttle bays, often deploying these ships to assist during armed engagements. Saga captains are famously accommodating of disabled starships, vacating these bays to allow vessels in distress to benefit from a Saga’s cutting-edge medical and repair facilities. This array of functionality allows a Saga to serve as a support ship for larger fleets, but Saga crews’ compassionate aid to countless strangers has won kasathas far more engagements than their weapons alone. Saga ships are such a well-recognized source of aid to those in distress across the Pact Worlds that “A Saga for sore eyes!” is a common exultation of relief.
