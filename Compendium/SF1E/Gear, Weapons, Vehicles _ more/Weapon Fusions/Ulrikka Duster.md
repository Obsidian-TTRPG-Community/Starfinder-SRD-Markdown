Effect: Dwarven asteroid miners favor the _Ulrikka duster_ fusion, which causes any weapon with it to take on an armored, stocky appearance. Attacks made with weapons with this fusion ignore half of a target item’s hardness. Use of such weapons has helped more than one short-supplied dwarven mining crew remove the last bits of useful material from an asteroid while still remaining armed enough to fight off space pirates.
