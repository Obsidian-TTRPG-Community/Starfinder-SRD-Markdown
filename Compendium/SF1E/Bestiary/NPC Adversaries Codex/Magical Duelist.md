# MAGICAL DUELIST

Across the universe, sapient species have independently discovered the societal benefits of friendly (and not-so-friendly) competition—as well as the fame and fortune that can be made by widely broadcasting such competitions to die-hard fans. While some cultures thrive on intellectual games of skill and strategy, others revel in fast-paced displays of martial might, brute strength, or deadly struggle. No matter the culture, those who succeed in these displays of wit and brawn can amass quite a bit of wealth, cultural clout, and even interplanetary notoriety.  
Sports figures are direct and to-the-point combatants with a focus on physicality, dexterity, or brute force, and they can easily serve in any role where violence is a means to an end. Re-skinned sports figures might serve as flashy mercenaries, daring pirates, specially trained guards, or hired muscle.

## DESCRIPTION

Every four years, hanakans hold an exhibition in their home system of Ash’Akan, where the most adept spellcasters throughout the galaxy display their technical expertise and most exciting thaumaturgical breakthroughs to win prestige for their respective homes. The magical fighting competition, named the Trials of Power, is one of the most eagerly awaited events of the symposium. While some attempt to win on wit or unexpected tactics, others attempt to show their proficiency through overwhelming arcane firepower.
