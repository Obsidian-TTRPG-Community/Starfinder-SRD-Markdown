# Magitech

**Source**:: _Starfinder Armory pg. 90_  
Requiring both surgical skill and arcane mastery to create and install, magitech [[Augmentations]]  are a combination of cybernetic and magical components. These [[Augmentations]] usually contain elements such as mystically charged crystals, starmetal alloys, and rune-covered microchips and are highly sought after by those who wish increase their magical might, such as technomancers. However, any spacefarer can benefit from even the most basic magitech [[Augmentations|augmentations]].  
  
Magitech [[Augmentations]]  follow much the same rules as all other [[Augmentations]]  in regards to implantation, activation, and removal (see page 208 of the _Core Rulebook_). Though they can be detected and crafted as if they were [[Atlas Hybrid Items]], once they are installed, they become a part of your body and generally can’t be affected by abilities that disable or destroy [[Hybrid Items]]
