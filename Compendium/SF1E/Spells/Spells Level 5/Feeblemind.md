## Description

You fire a scintillating ray at your target, making a ranged attack against your target’s EAC, but you can add your key ability score bonus to this attack instead of your Dexterity modifier if it is higher. If you hit and your target fails its Will saving throw, the target creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores each drop to 1 (a modifier of –5). The affected creature is unable to use Intelligence- or Charisma-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. It still knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The target remains in this state until a _miracle_, _psychic surgery_, _wish_, or similar spell is used to cancel the effect. It can’t be removed by effects like _break enchantment_.
