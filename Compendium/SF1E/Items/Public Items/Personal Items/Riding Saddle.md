Riding saddles come in a wide range of styles and configurations, but all are meant to allow a rider to work in concert with a mount. With 1 minute of work, you can saddle or unsaddle your creature companion. The GM might rule that unusual mounts take longer to saddle, though this does not usually increase the cost or bulk of the saddle. While riding a saddled creature companion, you don’t take the –5 penalty to Survival checks to ride an unsaddled creature. The GM might allow you to attempt a Survival check in order to saddle a friendly creature that is not your companion; the DC of this check is usually 15 + 1-1/2 × the creature’s level or CR. While worn, the bulk of the saddle does not count as bulk carried by the creature.
