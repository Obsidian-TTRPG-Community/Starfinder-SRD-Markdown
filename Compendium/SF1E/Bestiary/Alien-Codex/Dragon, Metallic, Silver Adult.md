## Adult Silver Dragon Cr 14

dragons are powerful reptilian creatures of high intelligence and great ingenuity. The vast majority of dragons fall into one of two categories: chromatic or metallic (though other categories exist). Chromatic dragons are often evil, indulging in machinations that benefit themselves or destroy their enemies. Metallic dragons (see below) are generally good, endeavoring to improve societal conditions for everyone. Dragons usually grow larger as they age, though a few dragons undergo expensive genetic modifications to remain small enough to fit within starships and space stations built by the humanoids of the Pact Worlds. Others develop the supernatural ability to change their forms to blend in with Pact Worlds society.
Several metallic dragons lead countries and corporations found within the Drakelands of Triaxus, occasionally engaging in warfare (corporate and militaristic) with the chromatic dragons of that planet. The metallic dragons claim these struggles are for the good of those under their care, though those same people are sometimes Trampled in the process.
