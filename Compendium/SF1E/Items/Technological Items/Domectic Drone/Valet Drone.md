## Valet Drone

Level:: 4

## Description

This Small drone is designed to aid in clothing selection, grooming, and light personal administrative tasks. A valet drone can speak the language it understands, though most valet drones are poor conversationalists and speak only to remind you of social obligations. A valet drone acts as the stealth drone of a 1st-level mechanic, except it has the manipulator arms mod and tool arm mod (containing an integrated hygiene kit and oversized mirror) instead of the stealth droneâ€™s normal initial mods. Its skill unit is Perception. A valet drone has 6 bulk.
