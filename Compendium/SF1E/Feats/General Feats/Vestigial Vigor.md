# VESTIGIAL VIGOR
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 131_  
Whether due to genetics or carefully targeted exercises, your vestigial arms are especially strong.

**Prerequisites**: Vestigial arms species trait

**Benefit**: You can combine the use of your vestigial arms to perform any one-handed task, including making attacks and using items. However, your reach with any weapons wielded by your vestigial arms is reduced by 5 feet.

**Special**: If you have at least four vestigial arms, you can take this feat a second time. If you do, your vestigial arms can be used as if they were two hands, each requiring the dedicated use of half your vestigial arms.
