### DESCRIPTION

After drinking this serum, your hands and feet become webbed and you grow gills. You gain a swim speed of 40 feet and your land speed is halved. You gain the ability to breathe water, and although you retain the ability to breathe air, you become fatigued if you breathe air for more than 10 minutes at a time. The effects of this serum last for 4 hours.
