Benefit: As a full action, you can mark a 5-foot square with specialized pheromones that encode a message you devise and, at your option, a direction. The message has a maximum number of words equal to your Charisma modifier or half your level, whichever is higher, and it can’t contain proper nouns. For example, you could convey “danger this way” with a direction, but not “Ask for Luwazi Elsebo.” To notice your pheromone markings, a creature within 15 feet must succeed at a Perception check with a DC equal to 20 + your level, and a creature interprets the message only if they exceed the check DC by 10 or more. A creature with blindsense (scent) or blindsight (scent) gains a +10 or +20 circumstance bonus respectively to detect and interpret your pheromone markings and can do so within the range of their sense if it’s greater than 15 feet.
Prerequisites: Blindsense (scent), blindsight (scent), or Survival 5 ranks
