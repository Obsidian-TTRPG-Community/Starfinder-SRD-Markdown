# Quartermaster

Military training hones experts with varied skillsets, tempering them in battlefield conditions. Mercenary work is an obvious outlet for their skills, but former military pros function well as security forces and rescue teams, and on exploration missions and supply delivery in dangerous areas. They might be found in more mundane settings, such as corporate facilities or research labs, especially in places where people or facilities need extra protection. Each of these NPCs has the following ability.  
**Unit Tactics (Ex)** Before rolling initiative, the character can choose to roll twice and take the lower result, and an ally within 30 feet can roll their initiative check twice and use the better result. When the character successfully uses covering fire, the selected ally gains the circumstance bonus to AC against the next two attacks made against them by creatures in the character’s line of effect.

### Special Abilities

**Resourceful Fighter (Ex)** A quartermaster can spend 1 Resolve Point as a move action to draw a set of ammunition, healing serum, technological item, personal item, grenade, or similar small device at the GM’s discretion. The item’s level can’t exceed one-third the quartermaster’s CR and can’t be more than 1 bulk. The item functions until the quartermaster regains their Resolve Points.

## Description

A quartermaster ensures equipment and supplies get where they need to go, are stored in good order, remain serviceable until needed, and oversees distribution. They’re not only capable bargainers: they also learn the basics of powered armor to operate cargo lifters and similar rigs.
