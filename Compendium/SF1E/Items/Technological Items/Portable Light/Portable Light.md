# Portable light

A portable light, sometimes called an electric torch, is one of several different devices that use batteries to create light sources. A portable light increases the light level by one step in an area determined by its model, as follows: flashlight (20- foot cone), lantern (10-foot radius), beacon (50-foot radius), and spotlight (100-foot cone).
