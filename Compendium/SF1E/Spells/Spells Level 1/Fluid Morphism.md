## Description

Lashuntas experimented with this magic based on their species' dimorphism. With this spell, you reignite the epigenetic processes that shaped the target and alter them, applying different environmental pressures to temporarily awaken dormant potential in the genetic code. Choose one ability score. You grant the target a +2 enhancement bonus to ability checks with that ability score and skill checks based on that score. While the spell lasts, you can use a standard action to change the affected ability score, provided the target is within range.
