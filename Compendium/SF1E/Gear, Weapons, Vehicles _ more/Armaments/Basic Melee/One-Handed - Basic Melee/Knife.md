# KNIFE
These light blades can be used for both mundane tasks and combat. A typical survival knife has a fixed, single-edged, carbonsteel or ceramic blade and is treated against corrosion. Tactical knives have large, double-edged blades, often with a section of serrated blade near the haft, and they come in both fixed- and folding-blade designs; users may prefer one style or the other, but the two are identical in terms of price, weight, and damage dealt.
