# LOCALIZED WATER ELEMENTAL - COMPANIONS

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 82_  
Water elementals are common on Kalo-Mahoi, and the longer they remain on the Material Plane, the more they tend to adapt, taking on a semipermanent shape. While this diminishes some of the elementalâ€™s resistances, it also drives them to imprint on and work with other creatures, such as kalos.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Demi-Elemental (Su)** A localized water elemental lacks elemental immunities. Instead, it gains a +2 bonus to saving throws against bleed, critical hit, paralysis, poison, sleep effects, and stunning effects. A localized elemental can be flanked.  
**Jet (Ex)** While in water, a localized water elemental can charge as a standard action without the normal charge penalties. When it deals damage at the end of a charge in this way, it deals additional damage equal to its level.  
**Water Manipulation (Su; 5th level)** A localized water elemental can attempt grapple or reposition combat maneuvers with a +2 circumstance bonus at a range of 30 feet so long as both the elemental and its target are in contact with the same body of water.
