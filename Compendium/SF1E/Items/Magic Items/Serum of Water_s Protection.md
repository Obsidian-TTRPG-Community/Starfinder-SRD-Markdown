A serum of water’s protection looks like a standard bottle of drinking water, but consuming it covers you with a thin layer of magically animated water. This has two effects, both of which last 1 hour. First, you gain resistance against acid and fire damage; a mk 1 serum of water’s protection grants acid and fire resistance 5, a mk 2 serum grants acid and fire resistance 10, and a mk 3 serum grants acid and fire resistance 15. Second, you become vulnerable to cold damage, taking 50% more damage from cold effects.

### Serums

Serums are vials of magic liquid that you can imbibe as a standard action or carefully trickle down the throat of a helpless or unconscious creature as a full action. Serums are normally 1 ounce of liquid (though it is possible to make serums with larger volumes, these are no more effective than standard serums), and lose potency if they are mixed with any other material. A serum can be used only once. Regardless of a serum’s actual item level, all serum vials have their hardness and Hit Points calculated as if they were 1st-level items.
