# ENVOY IMPROVISATIONS
You learn your first envoy improvisation at 1st level and an additional improvisation at 2nd level and every 2 levels thereafter. Many improvisations require you to have a minimum envoy level, and they are organized accordingly. Some improvisations have additional prerequisites, such as other improvisations.  


 
**Language-Dependent Improvisation**  
**Mind-Affecting Improvisation**  
**Sense-Dependent Improvisation**


###  A FEW MORE STEPS! (EX) 
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 22_  
As a reaction when an ally within 60 feet of you is reduced to 0 HP and would become unconscious, you can compel them to stay up and stagger out of the fray. The ally remains conscious, becomes nauseated, and gains temporary Hit Points equal to your envoy level + your Charisma modifier until the end of their next turn. Afterward, if the ally has 0 Hit Points, they become unconscious and dying as normal, including losing 1 Resolve Point at the end of their turn. Once a creature has been affected by this improvisation, they’re immune to it for 24 hours.  
At 6th level, the ally becomes staggered and off-target rather than nauseated. If the ally is stable and unconscious and spends 1 Resolve Point to regain 1 HP within 1 minute of falling unconscious, they instead regain HP equal to your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. 

###  BRACE YOURSELVES (EX) 
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 144_  
As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus to AC if adjacent to at least one other ally, as you all position yourselves so that your armor protects you better. The bonus persists even if the enemy moves beyond 60 feet or out of line of sight or hearing.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant this bonus to AC against attacks made by all enemies within 60 feet. 

###  CLEVER FEINT (EX) 
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
As a standard action, you can fake out an enemy within 60 feet, making that enemy open to your attacks. Attempt a Bluff check with the same DC as a check to feint against that enemy (though this isn’t a standard check to feint, so Improved Feint and Greater Feint don’t apply). Even if you fail, that enemy is flat-footed against your attacks (see page 276) until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, the enemy is also flat-footed against your allies’ attacks until the end of your next turn. You can’t use clever feint against a creature that lacks an Intelligence score.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Bluff check for clever feint as if it were a success. 

###  COORDINATED RELOAD (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 144_  
As a move action, you can grant a single move action to an ally within 60 feet. The ally can use that move action during her next turn to reload or draw a weapon. As part of the move action to activate this ability, you can also reload or draw a weapon. If the ally is adjacent to you, she can draw weapons and use ammunition you are carrying as though she were carrying them herself. The ally can use her extra move action in between her other actions, as well as before or after a full action. A character can use no more than one bonus action from coordinated reload or similar abilities (such as the quick quaff and hurry envoy improvisations) in a single round. 

###  DISPIRITING TAUNT (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
As a standard action, you can taunt an enemy within 60 feet. Attempt an Intimidate check with the same DC as a check to demoralize that enemy (though this isn’t a check to demoralize, so you can’t use abilities that would apply to a demoralization attempt, like the rattling presence expertise talent). If you fail, that enemy is off-target (see page 276) until the end of your next turn. If you succeed, that enemy is instead shaken (see page 277) until the end of your next turn. This is an emotion and fear effect.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to treat a failed Intimidate check for dispiriting taunt as if it were a success. 

### DON'T QUIT (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
As a standard action, you can signal a single ally within 60 feet. That ally ignores one condition (see page 273) of your choice until the start of your next turn, chosen from the following list: confused, fascinated, fatigued, shaken, sickened, and staggered.

While your ally doesn’t suffer the effects of the condition during that period, the condition is merely suppressed, not removed, and its effects resume at the start of your next turn. The condition can still be removed with spells, technology, and other effects as normal.

At 6th level, add the following conditions to the list: cowering, dazed, exhausted, frightened, nauseated, panicked, paralyzed, and stunned.

At 12th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to remove the condition with this ability instead of suppressing it. You can’t remove a condition with a permanent duration (see page 271) in this way; if you attempt to do so, your attempt fails but you don’t lose the Resolve Point. 

###  EXPANDED ATTUNEMENT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
You can use beneficial mind-affecting envoy improvisations to aid allies who usually would not be able to gain benefits from mind-affecting effects, such as constructs, robots, and undead. If the improvisation grants a morale bonus, even allies who can’t normally benefit from morale bonuses gain that bonus. 

###  FIRE SUPPORT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 144_  
When you take a standard action to provide harrying fire and hit the AC of 15 required to do so, you also provide covering fire for the next ally attacked by the target of your harrying fire attacks before your next turn.

Additionally, as a full action, you can make two ranged attack rolls against two different targets, taking a –4 penalty to each attack roll, to apply harrying fire to each target hit. For each target that you successfully apply harrying fire to, you also provide covering fire for the next ally that is attacked by either target before your next turn. 

###  GET 'EM (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies gain a +1 morale bonus to attack rolls made against that enemy. The bonus persists even if the enemy moves beyond 60 feet or out of line of sight or hearing.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to grant this bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls against all enemies who are within 60 feet. 

###  GOT YOUR BACK (EX)
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 22_  
As a move action, you grant the unflankable universal creature rule to yourself and a number of creatures that doesn’t exceed your Charisma modifier. When you use this improvisation, each creature affected must be within the melee reach of at least one other affected creature. The effect ends for an affected creature if it ends its turn without being in the melee reach of an affected ally. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn. If you spend a Resolve Point when activating the improvisation, it instead lasts a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier. 

###  INSPIRING BOOST (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
As a standard action, you can signal an ally within 30 feet who has taken damage from any attack made by a significant enemy (see page 242) at any point after your last turn ended. That ally regains a number of Stamina Points (up to his maximum) equal to twice your envoy level + your Charisma modifier; at 15th level, this increases to three times your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost, that ally can’t gain the benefits of your inspiring boost again until he takes a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add your envoy level to the number of Stamina Points regained. 

###  LOOK ALIVE (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
When you spend a Resolve Point to regain Stamina Points after a 10-minute rest, all allies who stay within 60 feet of you throughout the rest gain a +2 morale bonus to Perception and initiative checks for the next hour or until the next 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points, whichever comes first. 

###  NOT IN THE FACE (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
As a move action, you can choose one enemy within 60 feet. That enemy must succeed at a Will save or take a –4 penalty to all attacks it makes against you until the end of your next turn.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make the enemy take the penalty with no saving throw allowed. 

###  ON MY MARK (EX)
**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 22_  
When you ready an action, you can also provide quick encouragement and directions. Any ally who readies a similar action—such as making an attack, even if with a different type of weapon—with the same trigger before you take your readied action gains a +1 morale bonus to their first attack roll or skill check performed as part of the readied action. If the readied action requires a skill check to which you can apply your skill expertise, you can forego rolling the die and instead choose one ally who readied the same action; that ally rolls your expertise die and applies the result as an insight bonus to their check. If the readied action involves an attack roll, you can roll your expertise die and add its result to the damage dealt by one ally who also readied an attack and successfully hit the target. Once a creature benefits from this improvisation, it can’t do so again until you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.

### PHALANX FIGHTING (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 69_  
Whenever you or an ally within 10 feet of you is wielding a shield, as a move action you can grant yourself and all allies within 10 feet of that ally the unaligned shield bonus of that shield until the start of your next turn. 

###  QUICK QUAFF (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 144_  
As a standard action, you can grant a single standard action to an ally within 60 feet. The ally can use that action during her next turn to draw or drink a serum or draw or inject a spell ampule. As part of the action to activate this ability, you can also draw a serum or spell ampule, or if you used a standard action, drink a serum or inject a spell ampule. If the ally is adjacent to you, she can draw serums and spell ampules that you are carrying as though she were carrying them herself. The ally can use her extra action in between her other actions, as well as before or after a full action. A character can use no more than one extra action from quick quaff or similar abilities (such as the coordinated reload or hurry envoy improvisations) in a single round. 

###  SPELL GEM UNDERSTANDING (SU)

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 96_  
You can use spell gems as if you were a spellcaster. For purposes of using spell gems, you treat all spells on the mystic, technomancer, and witchwarper spell lists as your class’s spell list, and you use Charisma as your key ability score for your spellcasting. Your effective caster level for any spell gems you use is equal to your envoy level 

###  SUPERIOR COVERING FIRE (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 69_  
When you take a standard action to provide covering fire and hit the AC 15 required, the target of your covering fire gains the circumstance bonus provided by your covering fire against all attacks attempted against them until the start of your next turn.  
Additionally, as a full action you can make two ranged attack rolls to provide covering fire to two different allies, taking a −4 penalty to each attack roll. For each target that you successfully apply covering fire to, the circumstance bonus provided by your covering fire applies against all attacks attempted against that ally until the start of your next turn. 
###  TAKE THE HIT (EX)

**Source** _Interstellar Species pg. 22_  
Not only are you ready to risk yourself to protect others—your sacrifice also inspires your companion. You gain Bodyguard as a bonus feat. If you already have Bodyguard, you instead gain In Harm’s Way as a bonus feat. If you use In Harm’s Way to intercept an attack that then reduces you to 0 Hit Points, you grant the attack’s original target a +1 morale bonus to AC, attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks, as well as a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. These benefits last for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma modifier or until you regain consciousness, whichever happens first. 

##  UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 62_  
When using a language-dependent improvisation that affects an enemy, you can use the improvisation against that enemy even if the two of you do not share a language. 

###  WATCH YOUR STEP (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
When an ally within 60 feet must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid a harmful effect, as a reaction before your ally attempts the saving throw, you can grant the ally a +2 bonus to that saving throw.

At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to have the ally roll twice on the saving throw and take the better result. Both of those rolls benefit from the +2 bonus provided by this ability.

## 2ND LEVEL

You must be at least 2nd level to choose the following envoy improvisations.  

###  EXPERT GUIDE (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 16_  
As a move action, you can attempt a DC 15 Survival check to identify a clear path. If you succeed, select one 5-foot square of difficult terrain that you can perceive, plus one additional 5-foot square for every 5 points by which the result of your check exceeds the DC. Until the end of your next turn, you and your allies can move through the indicated spaces as though they weren’t difficult terrain. 

###  SHOO! (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 16_  
As a standard action, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize a creature with the animal or vermin creature type within 60 feet of you. If you succeed, the target must also succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 your envoy level + your Charisma modifier) or become frightened for 1 round or until it takes an action to move away from you. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, it’s immune for 24 hours.  
At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to target multiple creatures with the animal or vermin creature type with this ability, up to a maximum number of creatures equal to half your envoy level. Attempt one Intimidate check against all your selected targets. The DC of the check is equal to the highest DC to demoralize any one of the foes, plus 1 for each additional target beyond the first. 

###  SPECTACLE (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 16_  
As a standard action, you can distract an opponent within 60 feet. Attempt a Bluff check; the DC of this check is equal to either 10 + your opponent’s total Sense Motive skill bonus or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. If you succeed, the target’s attention is locked on you, giving it a –2 penalty to Perception checks other than those made against you as well as a –2 penalty to attack rolls for any attack that doesn’t include you as a target. This effect lasts until the end of your next turn or until the target can no longer perceive you with a precise sense. As a move action, you can extend the effect’s duration until the end of your following turn.  
At 6th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to affect multiple creatures, up to a maximum of half your envoy level. Attempt one check against all of the targets. The DC of the check is equal to the DC to use spectacle against the creature with the highest CR of those you’re attempting to affect, plus 1 for each target beyond the first. When you extend the effect, the duration increases for all targets. However, the effect ends for a target (though not necessarily for other targets) once that target can no longer perceive you with a precise sense.

## 4TH LEVEL

You must be at least 4th level to choose the following envoy improvisations.  

### BORROWED ARCANA (SP)

**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 21_  
You can spend 1 Resolve Point to draw magic from a willing or unconscious ally within 30 feet of you, casting one of their spells as a spell-like ability. The spell’s level cannot exceed the maximum spell level you can empower with your spell speaker ability, and the ally must expend the appropriate available spell slot. You use your envoy level as the caster level, and you use your Charisma modifier to calculate the spell’s saving throw DCs. Activating this improvisation and casting the spell takes a standard action or an amount of time equal to the spell’s casting time, whichever is longer. Each time you use this improvisation per day, its Resolve Point cost increases by 1.  
You must be 4th level and have the spell speaker alternate class ability to choose this improvisation. 

###  CLEVER ATTACK (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
You can make an attack that throws your enemy off-balance.

Apply the effects of clever feint before resolving your attack. You must have the clever feint envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation. 

###  DUCK UNDER (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
You can duck under a foe’s melee attack, causing it to overextend and move into a position more favorable to you. You must take the total defense action (see page 247) to use this ability.

###  FOCUS (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
As a standard action, you can encourage a single ally within 60 feet to focus on the danger at hand. If that ally is flat-footed or off-target, you end that condition.

A character can use no more than one extra action from hurry in a single round.

###  PERFECT INSULT (EX)

As a standard action, you study a creature to cultivate the perfect insult. Attempt a Culture check with a DC equal to 10 + your opponent’s total Bluff skill bonus, or 15 + 1-1/2 × the opponent’s CR, whichever is greater. If you succeed, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to Bluff and Intimidate checks against that opponent for 1 minute. If you spend 1 Resolve Point, allies within 60 feet also gain this bonus for the same duration. Once you’ve attempted to craft a perfect insult against a creature, you can’t target that creature again with this ability for 24 hours. 

###  QUICK DISPIRITING TAUNT (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_

All of the characters who took a guarded step using this improvisation have their speed reduced by 5 feet until the end of their next turn. 

###  TERRIFYING BLAST (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 144_  
When you throw a grenade, each creature within the radius of the explosion that fails its Reflex save against the grenade and takes damage from it must succeed at a Will save or gain the shaken condition for 1 round. This is a fear effect. 

###  WATCH OUT (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
As a reaction, when an enemy makes a ranged attack against an ally within 60 feet of you, you can warn that ally of the danger. You must spend your reaction when the enemy declares the attack but before it makes the attack roll. Your ally can spend a reaction to gain a +4 to AC against the triggering attack. Once the triggering attack is resolved, the ally falls prone.

At 8th level, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to prevent your ally from falling prone after the attack. 

###  YOU’VE GOT THIS (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 16_  
When an ally within 60 feet fails an Acrobatics or Athletics check, as a reaction, you allow that ally to reroll the check, using your modifier for the skill if it’s better than theirs.

Additionally, when you make a Medicine check to treat disease or treat drugs or poison, or successfully aid another for another creature’s Medicine check to do so, if the Medicine check is successful, the saving throw bonus granted by the skill checks increases to +6. If the associated saving throw succeeds, it counts as two consecutive successes for the purposes of curing the intended affliction. 

###  CLEVER IMPROVISATIONS (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
The first time you would spend Resolve Points on one of your envoy improvisations, reduce the cost by 1 Resolve Point (minimum 0). This ability refreshes whenever you take a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points and after an 8-hour rest to recover Resolve Points, reducing the Resolve Point cost of your next envoy improvisation after the rest. 

###  COORDINATED BARRAGE (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 70_  
As a move action, choose one ally within 60 feet. That ally gains the benefit of the Coordinated Shot feat. If the chosen ally already has this feat, they do not grant foes cover against attacks made by you and your allies. The effects of this improvisation last until the start of your next turn. 

###  COORDINATED FLANKERS (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 70_  
As a move action, you can coordinate your allies into effective flanking partners. Until the start of your next turn, you and your allies count as flanking any creature that at least two of you threaten, regardless of your position. 

###  DRAW FIRE (EX)

As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to make all enemies within 100 feet take a –4 penalty to all ranged attacks they make that don’t target you until the end of your next turn. This penalty remains even if you and an enemy move more than 100 feet away from each other, and enemies that weren’t within 100 feet when you used draw fire don’t take the penalty if they later come within range. 

###  FAST CAMOUFLAGE (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 16_  
You can use a disguise kit for 1d3 rounds to apply basic camouflage to yourself suitable for a specific biome; without a disguise kit, it takes 1d3 minutes to scavenge suitable materials and apply the camouflage. While wearing this disguise in that biome, you can apply your expertise ability to your Stealth checks. The camouflage lasts for 1 hour.  
If you spend 1 Resolve Point when using this ability, you can instead apply the camouflage to a willing adjacent creature, applying your expertise die to the creature’s Stealth checks. Once any other creature has benefited from this improvisation, it can’t gain the benefits again until it has taken a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points. 

###  HEADS UP (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_

###  IMPROVED GET 'EM (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 63_  
Your morale bonus from get ’em increases to +2. As a standard action, you can make a single attack against a target within 60 feet. You and your allies within 60 feet gain the benefits of get ’em against that target (applying these effects before making the attack roll).

If you do, all allies within 60 feet of you regain a number of Stamina Points equal to twice your envoy level + your Charisma modifier (up to their maximum); at 15th level, this increases to three times your envoy level + your Charisma modifier. Once an ally has benefited from your inspiring boost or inspiring oration, that ally can’t gain the benefits of either improvisation again until they recover Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.  
As with the inspiring boost envoy improvisation, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to add your envoy level to the number of Stamina Points regained. You must have the inspiring boost improvisation to select this improvisation. 

###  NATURAL SPECTACLE (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 17_  
Once per minute, you can extend your spectacle ability’s duration as a swift action rather than a move action. The effect of your spectacle ends for a creature only when the duration ends or when you end your turn where the creature can no longer perceive you with a precise sense. You must have the spectacle envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation. 

###  QUICK PERFECT INSULT (EX)

The creature becomes flat-footed until the start of your next turn. If there’s more than one creature of the same species present, this applies to all creatures of that species within 60 feet that can hear you. You can only use this ability once per species until you have taken a 10-minute rest to recover Stamina Points. 

###  TAKE ’EM ALIVE (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 17_  
You can urge your companions to avoid killing blows at the last second. To use this ability, you must be within 60 feet of both an ally and your ally’s target, the latter which must have taken damage from a nonlethal attack within the last minute. If your ally would reduce the target to 0 HP—and the attack doesn’t deal damage that equals or exceeds half the target’s maximum Hit Points—then, as a reaction, you can have the target merely fall unconscious from the attack as though the attack had dealt nonlethal damage. 

###  TRUST YOUR GEAR (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_  
As a move action, you can select an ally within 60 feet. Until the start of your next turn, that ally gains one of the following benefits: he can treat the armor check penalty of his armor as 4 lower than normal (to a minimum of 0); he can ignore the penalties for using armor or a weapon he is not proficient with; or he can ignore the broken condition of an item he is wearing or using.

## 8TH LEVEL

###  CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 17_  
As a reaction, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to change the triggering condition for the readied action of an ally within 60 feet, but you don’t change the readied action. Once a creature has been affected by this ability, they become immune to it for 24 hours. 

##  COORDINATED MANEUVERS (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 70_  
Whenever an ally within 60 feet attempts to use a combat maneuver against an opponent, as a reaction you can signal weak points in the opponent’s defenses. The ally gains a morale bonus to their attack roll for that combat maneuver equal to 1d4+1. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest. 

###  DESPERATE DEFENSE (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_  
As a move action, you can cause one ally adjacent to you to not be considered helpless (see page 276) for the purpose of actions that can be used only against helpless creatures (such as a coup de grace). This effect ends if the creature ceases to be adjacent to you or at the beginning of your next turn, whichever comes first. 

###  EARLY WARNING (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 17_  
You can use a reaction before the first time you act in a combat, but only to use an envoy improvisation. You can’t use early warning during a surprise round. 

###  EXPERT ATTACK (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_  
As a move action, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to add your bonus from expertise to your next attack roll before the end of your turn. 

###  HIDDEN AGENDA (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_  
You’re an expert at veiling your true thoughts and goals. Whenever a creature attempts a Sense Motive check to detect a deception of yours, the creature must roll twice and take the worse of the two results. When you attempt a saving throw against an effect or ability that would read your thoughts or reveal your motives, you can roll twice and take the better of the two results. 

###  IMPROVED BRACE YOURSELVES (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_  
You can use the hurry envoy improvisation as a move action instead of a standard action. You must have the hurry envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation.

**Source** _Starfinder Armory pg. 145_  
When you use the terrifying blast envoy improvisation, the amount of rounds that creatures are shaken due to failing the Will save increases to 1d4+1 rounds. You must have the terrifying blast envoy improvisation to choose this improvisation. This is a fear effect. 

###  JUST LIKE THAT! (EX)
**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 17_  
When you or an ally scores a critical hit against a creature, as a reaction, you can encourage a number of allies equal to your Charisma modifier to continue fighting that creature. For 1 round, the encouraged allies can score a critical hit against the creature on a natural 19 or 20; this effect ends immediately after an encouraged ally scores a critical hit against the target. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again for 1 minute. 

###  QUICK STUDY (EX)

**Source** _Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 17_  
As a move action, you become proficient with a type of weapon with which another ally within 30 feet is proficient. If that ally has weapon specialization with that weapon type, you can also apply that ally’s weapon specialization with that weapon type. This ability’s effects last a number of rounds equal to half your envoy level, after which you can’t use this ability again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest.

### REPRIMAND SPELL (SU)
**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 21_  
As a standard action, you spend 1 Resolve Point to scold a spell out of existence. This functions as dispel magic with a range of 30 feet, using your envoy level as your caster level.  
At 12th level, you can instead spend 2 Resolve Points to cast dispel magic as a reaction, using its counter function against a spell that affects any target or creature within 30 feet of you. If your dispel check exceeds the DC by 10 or more, you convince the spell to follow your commands and can select a new target (or targets, as appropriate) for the spell within the spell’s original range. The spellcaster loses the ability to dismiss the spell, and you gain that ability.  
You must be 8th level and have the spell speaker alternate class ability to choose this improvisation. 

###  SCAPEGOAT (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Merchants of the Void pg. 51_  
Through a mix of complex manipulation and other cues, you focus enemies’ fire on an ally. As a standard action, you can spend 1 Resolve Point and select a willing ally within 30 feet. Until the end of your next turn, enemies within 100 feet of that ally who can sense both you and that ally take a –4 penalty to all ranged attacks they make that don’t target that ally. This ability otherwise acts as if that ally used the draw fire improvisation. You must have the draw fire improvisation to choose this improvisation. 

###  SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 70_  
As a reaction, whenever you or one of your allies critically hits a creature, you can choose one ally within 60 feet of the target of the critical hit. The chosen ally can immediately attack the target creature with one weapon they’re currently wielding as a reaction. If they do, the chosen ally takes a −4 penalty to their attack roll and is staggered until the end of their next turn. Characters who can’t be staggered can’t benefit from this improvisation. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest. 

###  SITUATIONAL AWARENESS (EX)

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_  
If you ready an action, once before the trigger you selected occurs, you can spend 1 Resolve Point to change both the trigger and the action you have ready. You must ready an action that takes the same kind of action as your originally readied action, or you must ready a lesser action. (For example, if you readied a standard action, you could switch to another standard action, a move action, or a swift action, and if you readied a move action, you could switch to another move action or a swift action.) 

###  SUSTAINED DETERMINATION (EX)
**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 64_  
As a move action, you can spend 2 Resolve Points to grant an ally within 60 feet 1 Resolve Point that he can spend to empower one of his abilities, even if he has spent all of his own Resolve Points. The ally must spend the Resolve Point before the start of your next turn; if he does not do so, he loses the Resolve Point and you still lose the Resolve Points you spent. You can’t grant the same ally the benefits of this ability again until both you and your ally have recovered your Resolve Points after an 8-hour rest or its equivalent.

## 10TH LEVEL

You must be at least 10th level to choose the following envoy improvisations.  

## SPELL SCOOT (SU)
**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 21_  
As a standard action, you can convince a spell effect to move. This functions as the targeted dispel function of dispel magic with a range of 60 feet, using your envoy level as your caster level. Rather than dispelling the effect, if you succeed, you move the spell’s area of effect a distance that cannot exceed 5 feet × your Charisma modifier. This adjustment cannot change the effect’s orientation, and the movement is instantaneous, causing no incidental damage or disruption as it moves to its new location. Alternatively, you can use this improvisation to clear the spell’s effect for 1 round from a number of 5-foot cubes that does not exceed your Charisma modifier, such as to clear a path through a wall of force.  
You must be 10th level and have the spell speaker alternate class ability to choose this improvisation.

## 12TH LEVEL

You must be at least 12th level to choose the following envoy improvisations.  

##  COORDINATED CHARGE (EX)
**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 70_  
Whenever you or an ally within 60 feet of you charges an opponent, you can signal all allies within 60 feet of the charging character as a reaction. Signaled characters can also charge the opponent as a reaction if the distance between the character and the charged opponent is equal to or less than the signaled character’s speed. All characters that charge an opponent using this improvisation are staggered until the end of their next turn. Characters who can’t be staggered can’t benefit from this improvisation. Once you use this ability, you can’t use it again until after you regain Stamina Points following a 10-minute rest. 

###  FUSION RESONANCE (SU) 

**Source** _Character Operations Manual pg. 70_  
As a standard action, choose yourself or one ally within 60 feet. The chosen character must be within 10 feet of you or another ally that is within 60 feet of you. Until the end of the chosen character’s turn, they can choose one weapon fusion on a weapon wielded by an ally within 10 feet of them. The chosen character applies the benefits of the chosen weapon fusion on all weapon attacks they make until the end of their next turn (except any to which the fusion could not normally apply). This fusion doesn’t count toward the maximum total level of fusions the chosen character’s weapons can have at once.
