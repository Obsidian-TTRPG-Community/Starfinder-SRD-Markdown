## Description

The Pirate Council of Broken Rock  provides what little leadership and direction the pirates of the Diaspora will accept, but only the most infamous and successful Free Captains are considered pirate lords and nominated for positions on the council. This political process is fraught with backstabbing and betrayal, as the current members of the Pirate Council are often reluctant to share their power with those whom they consider newcomers.  
Each pirate lord commands a fleet of starships and controls one of the innumerable asteroid bases, hidden dockyards, and pirate ports in the Diaspora. A few pirate lords own gaudy mansions on Broken Rock and spend a lot of their time lounging within them, delegating control of their fleets to trusted underlings. Other pirate lords tend to scoff at these hands-off pirate lords.  
**Adaptation:** A pirate lord could be a flashy warlord commanding a personal fleet of starships or an organized crime boss. Alternatively, a pirate lord could be a famous pirate hunter, fearlessly tracking down wanted pirates and bringing them to justice.
