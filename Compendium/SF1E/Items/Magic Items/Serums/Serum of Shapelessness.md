### Description

This liquid in this vial constantly roils within, ever shifting in viscosity and color. Imbibing this serum transforms you into a color-changing, shapeless mist, granting you the incorporeal universal creature rule until the end of your next turn. If a creature that’s incorporeal as a result of drinking the serum of the shapeless ends its turn adjacent to another creature that’s incorporeal for the same reason, each creature adds the applicable ability modifier of the creature it shares a space with when attempting its check or roll. Only two incorporeal creatures can benefit from this effect at a time.
