## Description

You overload a target’s mind with so much psychic stimuli that it ripples to another target, triggering the initial spell as well as overloading the new target with residual psychic overload. This spell deals 2d8 damage to the target, plus 2d8 damage for each prior target that already took damage from this casting of the spell. You choose the order in which targets are affected. Each secondary target of this spell takes a –1 penalty to their Will Save for each opposing alignment of the primary target (so if the primary target was lawful evil, a secondary chaotic evil target takes a –1 penalty, and a secondary chaotic good target takes a –2 penalty). If this spell damages four targets, it incites a thought storm that causes each target to become confused (as per the confusion spell) for 1 round on a failed save.
