### DESCRIPTION

Dromada artisans developed this serum to make themselves less palatable. When consumed, this serum suppresses any delicious racial ability you have for 1d4+1 hours. In addition, for the first 10 minutes, your body becomes universally foul-tasting, causing any creature that damages you with a bite or tongue attack to become sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + your Constitution modifier).
