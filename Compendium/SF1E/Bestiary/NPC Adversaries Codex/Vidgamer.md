# VIDGAMER
Celebrities shine in ways that often draw admiration, adoration, or amusement from fans across their home worlds and beyond. They regularly engage with fans through interviews, social media, and special appearances, boosting their sway in the court of public opinion. Some celebrities use their massive platforms to influence policy and elections, and itâ€™s not uncommon for groups with specific political or corporate interests to secretly plant or sponsor celebrities to advance particular agendas.
