This massive sports grid and concert venue requires three expansion bays and can be installed only on Huge or larger starships. Extensive seating, speakers, and vidscreens allow someone using the entertain downtime activity (Starfinder Character Operations Manual 152) to affect up to 200 willing creatures. The DC of their entertain check is equal to 10 + 1 per 20 creatures they’re entertaining + 1-1/2 × the average character level or CR of those they’re entertaining.
