## Description

_* 6 Build Points are available for customizing the expansion bays in this versatile ship._  
 
Reliants earn their name by having a wide range of potential loadouts that make them reliably useful in many different situations. An easily swappable set of bays in the ship’s stern is the cornerstone of its flexibility.
