### Description

This lightweight buggy can deploy seismographic spikes and scanning equipment into the ground, allowing its crew to find and mark deposits of valuable metals and crystals. A small, sensor-resistant compartment underneath the passenger seats is designed to store traces of particularly valuable materials found while prospecting, though this is often repurposed by unscrupulous owners.
