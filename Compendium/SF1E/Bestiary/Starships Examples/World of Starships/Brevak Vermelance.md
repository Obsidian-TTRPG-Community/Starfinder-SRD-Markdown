## Description

Originally constructed and employed by Apostae’s House Brevak to operate as both a show ship and mobile arms-dealing platform, the formidable Vermelance is now a staple in the cutthroat world of drow business. These ships are made from the repurposed corpses of vermeliths—massive, rock-eating, silicon-based space worms—slain by Apostae outriders near the Diaspora. Inspired by the disconcerting effects its appearance has on potential enemies, drow traders emphasize the Vermelance’s intimidation factor as part of their business strategy
if the mere sight of the starship throws potential partners or rivals off their game, negotiations might sway in the owners’ favor.  
 
Of course, many species in the galaxy are not so easily intimidated, so House Brevak is happy to treat dignitaries and potential buyers to firsthand demonstrations of the ship’s combat prowess and maneuverability during which they can also enjoy the ship’s lavishly appointed accommodations. While the Vermelance often serves as a show ship, it possesses genuine lethality, darting through space with impossibly agile twists and turns. Drow technicians enhance the naturally articulated body of the Vermelance with electromechanical rigging, enabling a well-coordinated team of pilots to bend and twist different portions of the once-living ship in elusive and dazzling combat maneuvers. Even so, some Vermelances demonstrate residual willfulness and minor glitches, as though the deceased creature were trying to regain consciousness and reclaim control of its corpse.  
 
Training crews of pilots to synchronize their movements across a single ship isn’t without its hazards. Rumors abound of a Vermelance that tore itself apart when its operators’ actions fell out of sync, but this might be a warning to spook pilot trainees, an outright lie spread by envious industry competitors, or a tall tale among would-be thieves.  

## Special Abilities
