# VESKARIUM MECHS
Before the historical events that cemented their allegiance with the Pact Worlds, the Veskarium poured their resources into designing combat-ready machines to empower their conquering forces. Many vesks believed Damoritosh himself demanded the creation of these “battle engines,” and priests often blessed the completed machines before battle. The invention of the battle core—each one treated as a relic dedicated to the Church of the Conqueror—earned mechs a lasting place in vesk religious iconography.  
The Warmander, sometimes nicknamed the skittertank, is based on an archaic design that was later resurrected and updated by skittermander engineers after the conquest of Vesk-3. Up to six operators can pilot the six-limbed amphibious siege engine.  
The High Despots first commissioned the Ripclaw during the Swarm War. Dubbed “bug hunters” by their first generation of pilots, these mechs were designed for two purposes: kill the Swarm, and never run out of bullets. Historically, Veskarium mechs were deployed to increase a ground unit’s firepower, and vesk pilots’ bullet-hungry tactics eventually necessitated the invention of support mechs. Rarely found outside the Veskarium, and largely out of commission in modern times, these transport frames had few functions other than delivering spare ammunition and weapons to deployed mechs.
