# Alluvion Theodolite

**Source**:: _Drift Crisis pg. 55_  
**Level**:: 3
**Price**::  1750 
**Bulk**:: 2

### Description

This clockwork precision instrument, often mounted on the bridge of a starship, allows you to glean the distance and direction of Alluvion, the itinerant city in the Drift. While you’re in the Drift, the theodolite gives you a +4 insight bonus to astrogate to Alluvion (though you must still have received coordinates from some other source).
