# Crisis Wrench

This short staff ends in reconfigurable wrench-like prongs suited for operating on heavy machinery, sawing through debris, and incapacitating robots gone haywire. Each crisis wrench has specially fitted compartments along its length that stores an engineering kit (Core Rulebook 221), and all crisis wrenches other than the tinker-class model also house an engineering specialty tool kit selected when purchasing the weapon. These kits are included in the weaponâ€™s price and bulk.
