# METAL NITRO
Introduced into a vehicle’s engine through the vehicle’s control panel, _metal nitro_ comes in magical capsules of soft metal. Unlike technological racing nitrous, which releases more oxygen into an engine’s system to help the fuel burn, _metal nitro_ infuses the vehicle with a burst of magical power.  
  
As a move action, you can crush a capsule of _metal nitro_ into a vehicle’s control panel, which increases the vehicle’s drive speed and full speed for a total of 10 rounds. If the pilot fails to take the race action within 1 round of activating the _metal nitro_ or fails the Piloting check to race from a dead stop, the _metal nitro_ forces the vehicle to move its full speed immediately in an uncontrolled manner. If the Pilot fails the check to race, or the nitro activates in an uncontrolled manner, the pilot and any passengers take bludgeoning damage according to the type of _metal nitro_.  
  
_Metal nitro_ can be safely used only on a vehicle that has an equal or higher item level. If you use _metal nitro_ of an item level higher than the target vehicle’s, the vehicle takes damage after the pilot races or the vehicle first moves because of the nitro. The amount of damage varies according to the type of _metal nitro_. The types of _metal nitro_ and their speed increase, as well as potential passenger and vehicle damage, are as follows.
