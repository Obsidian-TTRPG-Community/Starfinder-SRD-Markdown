While its synthskin is active, an infiltration robot appears to be a member of a medium-sized humanoid or monstrous humanoid species (chosen at the robot’s creation) and it is not vulnerable to critical hits or electricity.

## Monitor-class Cr 2

Beneath layers of synthskin and expert disguises, every infiltration robot is basically identical. A spindly, humanoid machine’s frame between 4 and 6 feet in height, lacking any feature that might indicate some specific design inspiration. By design, however, this interior is rarely seen. To most, an infiltration robot simply looks like some humanoid they know: a grocer, a pilot, or even a coworker with a penchant for cheesy snacks.
These disguises are made possible by the synthskin that coats every infiltration robot. Synthskin is a pliable, synthetic substance that can be tuned to perfectly mimic a variety of humanoid species, even simulating blood and internal organs. Paired with an adjustable chassis, synthskin allows infiltration robots to be built as near-perfect replicas of a variety of humanoid species and subspecies. Social mimicry is handled by advanced processing centers that border on true AI, allowing for swift swapping between simulated personalities as well as resulting in all the quirks and personality development of intelligent life.
The most basic form of infiltration robot is the monitor class. Monitors are primarily meant to observe and report upon their targets. While capable of combat, and in theory assassination, it is generally considered a last resort. Whatever information the monitor can get back to its controller is likely far more valuable than anyone it could reasonably kill, and damage from combat risks revealing the mechanical nature of the spy. As such, if a monitor initiates combat is likely believes that it has been found out, or that something far more valuable than its mission is at stake.
More advanced by far are exterminator-class infiltration robots. Exterminators feature prototype nanobot swarms embedded in their chassis, allowing them to shrug off damage and swiftly repair their synthskin if it is damaged in battle. They can also effortlessly reshape their synthskin, changing their height, color, gender expression, apparent age, and species on the fly. This makes them both more resilient in battle and far more adaptable as assassins than monitor-class robots, as they can shift disguises as often as needed to approach virtually any target unsuspected. This adaptability also makes them much more aggressive
exterminators whose disguise is compromised can simply shift into another, so they are much more likely to initiate deadly combat without concern for their discovery.
