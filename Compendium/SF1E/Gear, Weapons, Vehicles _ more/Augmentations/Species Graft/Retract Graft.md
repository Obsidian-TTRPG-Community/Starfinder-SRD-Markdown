# RETRACT GRAFT
**Source** _Alien Archive 4 pg. 146_  
**Item Level** 4; **Price** 2,100; **System** Spinal Column  
Tortoise-like creatures, telias can retract their heads and limbs into their shells for protection. Compressors within your skeleton grant you a similar defense. When you take the total defense action, you gain a +6 bonus to your Armor Class (instead of the usual +4 bonus), and also gain the unflankable universal creature rule until the start of your next turn.
