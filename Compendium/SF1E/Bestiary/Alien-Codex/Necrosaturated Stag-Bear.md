### Special Abilities

**Determined Charge (Ex)** A stag-bear can charge without taking the normal charge penalties to its attack roll or AC. In addition, it can charge through difficult terrain.  
**Disruptive Susceptibility (Su)** A necrosaturated creature takes half again as much damage (+50%) when it takes damage from a weapon with a disruptive fusion.  
**Too Tough to Die (Ex)** Twice per day, when a necrosaturated stag-bear would be reduced to 0 Hit Points, it can use its reaction to remain at 1 Hit Point instead. It can’t use this ability if a critical hit reduced it to 0 Hit Points. Each time it uses this ability, it gains a cumulative –2 penalty to attack rolls for 24 hours.

## Description

Some animals, magical beasts, and vermin contaminated with lingering negative energy begin to rot while still alive, rather that succumbing to the mercy of a swift death. Their flesh withers, making them resemble undead, even though they remain terribly—and painfully—alive.  
  
The stag-bear is an omnivorous herd animal found throughout the plains across Weydana-4. The creatures resemble broad-shouldered bears with a wide rack of antlers. Stag-bears rarely pose a threat unless provoked.
