### Description

These stylish boots contain antigravity circuitry that, when activated, suspends you approximately 1 inch off the ground. You do not count as flying when using hoverskates; you move at your normal land speed when wearing them. You can walk both overland and over water (but not underwater), and you can ignore difficult terrain. When you take a move action to move your speed, you can increase your land speed by 20 feet by overcharging your hoverskates. This extra movement is treated as an enhancement bonus. The hoverskates must cool down for 1 minute before you can overcharge them again.  
  
Hoverskates do not function if you’re encumbered or overburdened.
