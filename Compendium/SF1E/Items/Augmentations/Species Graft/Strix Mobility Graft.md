Strix are known for their massive feathery wings, and you have a similar pair of appendages (either organic or mechanical) attached to your back. This grants you an extraordinary fly speed of 30 feet with average maneuverability, though it does decrease your land speed by 10 feet due to your wings’ size and bulk.
