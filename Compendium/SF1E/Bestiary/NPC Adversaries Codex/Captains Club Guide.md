# Captains Club Guide

Guides provide safe passage for a fee, shepherding travelers through dangerous or unfamiliar territory. Most specialize in a specific region, using their knowledge, connections, and adaptability to bring clients to their destination in one piece. Used to situations where they and their clients are on their own, guides tend to prefer finesse to force in tough situations, but if charm doesn’t work, they’ll do whatever it takes to get the job done.  
While the most straightforward way for players to encounter a guide is by hiring one, guides offer a variety of other potential encounters. Players might find a stowalong on their ship, retrace a captains club guide’s adventure, use a personal concierge to gain access to power, or help a courier track down a local rumor. Guides also often have valuable information about planetary conditions, know the location of unexplored sites, and can make connections with influential locals.

## Description

Guides in this unofficial alliance of retired explorers—most of whom weren’t actually captains—can usually be coaxed away from retirement for “one last jaunt” to somewhere they visited in their more active days. While their information is occasionally out of date, they make up for it with quick thinking, a higher- than-expected ability to defend themselves, and the weight of their name and reputation. That reputation is also usually the way they gain work, often spreading news of their exploits around a sector and hinting there might be more adventures yet to come.
