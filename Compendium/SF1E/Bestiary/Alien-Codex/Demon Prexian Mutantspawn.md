## Prexian Mutantspawn Cr 11

## Description

The Abyss is a warped mirror that reflects all sinful possibility in mortal life, and as mortals advance technologically, so too advances their capacity to sin. Pluprex demons are one such modern reflection—incarnations of the cruelties and devastation wrought by those who harness the power of radiation to do harm.
A pluprex forms from the sinful soul of a mortal who, in life, gloried in the use of radiation as a weapon or who used radiation to experiment on unwilling subjects or to poison the innocent. Many pluprexes died of radiation poisoning themselves in their mortal lives. A typical pluprex stands 7 feet tall but weighs only 100 pounds.
For some victims of a pluprex’s invoked mutation, death is only the beginning. When a victim of an invoked mutation perishes in the Abyss or in an area suffused with chaotic and evil energies, mutations in its flesh can sometimes animate into a horrific form of life known as a prexian mutantspawn. These deformed monstrosities claw their way loose from their hosts’ dead bodies as collections of misshapen bones, sinew, teeth, and tumors that shouldn’t be able to live, yet somehow do so with fervor.
A prexian mutantspawn’s shape may vaguely resemble that of its original host body, but it has none of the birth corpse’s memories, skills, or abilities. The transformation into a mutantspawn has no effect on a creature’s soul, and the mutantspawn is a new form of outsider life, not an undead—a creature that dies and then spawns a mutantspawn from their body can be brought back to life normally.
