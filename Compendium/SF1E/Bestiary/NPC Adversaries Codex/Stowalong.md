# Stowalong

Guides provide safe passage for a fee, shepherding travelers through dangerous or unfamiliar territory. Most specialize in a specific region, using their knowledge, connections, and adaptability to bring clients to their destination in one piece. Used to situations where they and their clients are on their own, guides tend to prefer finesse to force in tough situations, but if charm doesn’t work, they’ll do whatever it takes to get the job done.  
While the most straightforward way for players to encounter a guide is by hiring one, guides offer a variety of other potential encounters. Players might find a stowalong on their ship, retrace a captains club guide’s adventure, use a personal concierge to gain access to power, or help a courier track down a local rumor. Guides also often have valuable information about planetary conditions, know the location of unexplored sites, and can make connections with influential locals.

### Special Abilities

**Take It Easy (Ex)** As a standard action, a stowalong can target an unfamiliar creature within 30 feet that isn’t engaged in combat. The target must attempt a Will save (DC = 11 + the stowalong’s CR). If it fails, the target’s attitude toward the stowalong and their allies improves by one category for one hour. This doesn’t count toward the once-per-day limitation for using Diplomacy to change a creature’s attitude.

## Description

Stowalongs trade their knowledge and skills for free passage on spacefaring vessels. Often experts in an entire system, they are well-connected fixers who everyone seems to know or owe a favor to. This allows them to do high-risk work, escorting customers through disputed or war-torn areas that other guides avoid. Between jobs, stowalongs look for clients in trade hubs and encourage crews they have traveled with to refer them to trusted associates.
