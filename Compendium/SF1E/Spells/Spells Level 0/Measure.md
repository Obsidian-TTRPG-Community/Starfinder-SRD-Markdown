## DESCRIPTION

You learn the approximate measurements (length, width, depth, height, mass) of creatures and objects you can observe in the area. If an object or creature extends out of the area, you learn only the measurements within the area but nothing about what you can't observe. For example, you can't determine the thickness or weight of a wall you can observe only one side of or the depth of water that extends beyond the spell's range. Each round you concentrate on the same area, you can learn the exact measurements of one creature or object in the area, including imprecisions or anomalies that might indicate structural weakness. A target magically altered to appear different than what you observe still gives you accurate measurements when you concentrate on it. Such anomalies might provide clues that other skills can help decipher, such as Engineering to determine if a structure can support your weight. Magical traps incorporate wards that thwart this spell, giving you information that reflects what you observe rather than accurate measurements. A force field blocks this spell.
