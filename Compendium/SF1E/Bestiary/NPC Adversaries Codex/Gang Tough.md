### Ecology

## Description

Gang toughs might be desperate survivors or violent individuals who thrive when their strength is rewarded. Many just want a quick path to money, no matter who they have to hurt to get it, but others work for gangs to simply keep themselves and their families safe. Regardless of their motives, they usually present themselves as unstoppable and utterly ruthless, fearing that any other type of behavior could be seen as weak. They brag and taunt in combat, hoping to scare foes into surrendering or simply fleeing.  
On Akiton, toughs are usually crimson-skinned Akitonian humans (known as the Hylki), androids, or ysoki. In Nightarch on Apostae, they tend to be half-orcs. On Absalom Station, a gang tough is equally likely to be of almost any race. On other planets, a tough is usually one of the dominant race of theÂ world.  
**Adaptation:** A gang tough can be a rough-and-tumble street vigilante or hired security at any business on Absalom Station or across the Pact Worlds.
