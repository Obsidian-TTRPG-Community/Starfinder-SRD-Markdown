## DESCRIPTION

You detect radiation in the surrounding area, and you can determine the specific intensity of the radiation of one area or object within the spellâ€™s area each round without taking an action (see Radiation on page 403 for more details). The spell can penetrate barriers, but 3 feet of dirt or wood, 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or any force field blocks it.
