# Bioluminescent Skin

**Source**:: _Interstellar Species pg. 59_  
**Level**:: 1
**Price**::  250 
**System**:: Skin  
Your skin is covered with elaborate bioluminescent patterns. You have precise control over your bioluminescence, including its color and brightness. You increase the light level by one step out to a radius of 20 feet (to a maximum of normal light). You can suppress or reactivate your bioluminescence by taking a move action. If you know Lumos, the cephalume language, you can use your bioluminescence to communicate in it.
