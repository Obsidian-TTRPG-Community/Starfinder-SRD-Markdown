# Physician

In many societies, practicing medicine requires extensive (and often formal) education and even certification. Yet the galaxy is a big, dangerous place, and some of the best healers are self-taught, work outside of official networks, or both. Altruism, prestige, or profit motivate most medics to provide life-saving care. However, medics can be villains, with criminals, charlatans, and unethical innovators willing to provide risky surgeries, experimental drugs, or cure-all placebos for the right price.

## Description

Physicians are accomplished medical staff with ample hands-on knowledge. However, exposure to suffering sometimes erodes a physicianâ€™s moral compass, driving them to violate medical taboos in a misguided attempt to invent new cures. Not only might this harm patients, but it could even lead to vengeful undead and other aggressive creations in the name of science.
