# Paranormal Investigator

Investigators uncover secrets and sift truth from lies. This often places investigators on the side of the law, but when the powers that be are corrupt, investigators might find themselves labeled vigilantes or ostracized. Yet they aren’t easily discouraged, and can become relentless foes.

## Description

Paranormal investigators study, confront, and banish that which doesn’t belong in the galaxy, including extraplanar beings, souls that refuse to pass on, and most undead. Most paranormal investigators are made, not born, their lives disrupted by the paranormal or occult. This makes many indifferent to the desires and plights of their targets—a “good” or “benevolent” intruder is no different than one who’s actively harmful to them.
