Benefit: As a standard action, you can broadcast a jarring telepathic screech into the minds of nearby enemies. You can use this ability on one target creature per character level, all of which must be within range of your telepathy. If you succeed at an Intimidate check (DC = 15 + 1 per target + 1-1/2 × the CR of the highest CR target), all targets are shaken for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every 5 by which your result exceeds the DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. Once you have targeted a creature with this feat, that foe is immune to this ability for 24 hours.
Prerequisites: Intimidate 3 ranks; limited telepathy or telepathy.
