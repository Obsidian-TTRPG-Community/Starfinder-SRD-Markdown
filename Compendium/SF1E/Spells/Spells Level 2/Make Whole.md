# MAKE WHOLE

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 364_  
**Classes** Precog 2, Technomancer 2, Witchwarper 2  
**School** transmutation  
**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Targets** one object of up to 1 bulk/level or one construct of any size  

## DESCRIPTION

This spell functions as _mending_, except it restores 5d6 Hit Points when cast on an object or construct creature.

_Make whole_ can fix destroyed magic items, and it restores the magic properties of the item if your technomancer level is at least twice the item’s level. Items with charges (such as batteries) and single-use items (such as potions and grenades) can’t be repaired in this way. When you cast _make whole_ on a construct, the spell bypasses any immunity to magic as if the spell did not allow spell resistance.
