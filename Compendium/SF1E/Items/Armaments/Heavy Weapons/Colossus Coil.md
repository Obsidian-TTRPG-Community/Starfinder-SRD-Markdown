# Colossus Coil

Where massive creatures roam, those who fight against them for survival develop colossal weapons. Such is the case with the colossus coil, a weapon said to have been developed to hunt colossi on the planet Daimalko. It has since spread to many systems, including the Pact Worlds. This heavy firearm has a barrel sporting a series of toroidal high-voltage generators that collectively produce powerful arcs of electricity, and it can be overcharged to deliver even more destructive blasts. The electric blast sometimes overwhelms its target, branching off to hit another. The corona colossus coil produces a ring of electricity, while a brush colossus coil produces a more diffuse field. A streamer arc colossus coil produces a traditional arc of electricity, while the multistream colossus coil generates multiple such streams for a devastating blast.

### Shock Weapons

Shock weapons emit powerful electrical blasts that can damage and potentially stun enemies. Ranged versions use a low-power laser to direct these weaponsâ€™ electrical arcs. Electrical blasts can also leap to adjacent targets, making the weapons well suited for stunning groups of enemies. In general, tempest shock weapons are the most powerful, followed in descending order by storm, aurora, and static shock weapons.
