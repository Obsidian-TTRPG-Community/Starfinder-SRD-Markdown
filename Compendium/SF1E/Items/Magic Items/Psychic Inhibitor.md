### Description

Crafted from shards of crystal mined in the Colonies and held together with an organic, waxy substance, a _psychic inhibitor_ has the ability to disrupt telepathic communications. You can hold a _psychic inhibitor_ in one hand and activate it once per day as a standard action by picturing a complex series of geometric shapes in your mind. When you do so, each creature with the limited telepathy or telepathy ability within 100 feet (including yourself) must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC = 10 + half your level + your key ability score modifier) or have their mind flooded with unbearable psychic noise. Each affected creature loses its limited telepathy or telepathy ability and takes a –2 penalty to attack rolls, a –4 penalty to Will saving throws, and a –8 penalty to Intelligence-, Wisdom-, and Charisma-based skills for 1 hour. This is a mind-affecting effect. A creature that succeeds at its save can’t be affected by the same _psychic inhibitor_ for 1 week.  
  
A _psychic inhibitor_ comes with four attuned _psychic disinhibitors_ (these are created at the same time as the _psychic inhibitor_ and are included in the price). A _psychic disinhibitor_ is a flexible disk 1 inch in diameter that can be affixed to a creature’s skin (preferably near the brain) to make the creature immune to the attuned _psychic inhibitor’s_ effects. A _psychic disinhibitor_ counts as a worn magic item.
