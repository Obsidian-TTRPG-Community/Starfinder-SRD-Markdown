## Description

The Omenbringer sails through the void like the corpse of some vast whale, but its organic aesthetics belie the cutting-edge technology of its construction. Within its gullet hang ranks of Necrogliders and other fighters, their undead pilots able to stay ready at their stations indefinitely. Without life support on many decks, the ship is very difficult to take down, and big sections (such as the hangars) stand airless and open to space by design.
