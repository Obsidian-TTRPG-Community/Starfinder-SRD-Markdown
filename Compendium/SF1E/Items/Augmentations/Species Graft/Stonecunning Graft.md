Although many dwarves now live in space stations, on starships, and in gleaming metal-and-glass buildings, they are still known for their ancestral ability to spot the smallest of flaws in worked stone. Your optical sensors are altered to provide the same benefit. You gain a +2 enhancement bonus to Perception checks to notice unusual stonework, such as traps and hidden doors located in stone walls or floors. You receive a check to notice such features whenever you pass within 10 feet of them, whether or not you are actively looking.
