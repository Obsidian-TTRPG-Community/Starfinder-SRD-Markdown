# Prophet

Religious figures are typically individuals who rise in their faith’s ranks due to their unrivaled devotion and skill—or even due to the blessings bestowed upon them by their deity. Religious figures don’t just lead the devout; they often also steer nonreligious discourse. Depending on their congregation and ambitions, the leader might even overshadow the government of a city or planet. Although this arrangement might bring peace, it could as easily realize a terrible regime of divine tyranny or terror.

### Special Abilities

**Fortuitous Prophecy (Su)** By performing a personalized ritual for 10 minutes, a prophet can bestow a prophecy on a willing creature within 30 feet. Once during the next year, the creature can invoke the prophecy before attempting an attack roll, skill check, or saving throw to roll the check 5 times and use the best result. Once a creature benefits from a fortuitous prophecy, they’re immune to further uses of this ability for 10 years.

## Description

Prophets are chosen by the gods to foretell the future, though they rarely have a choice in the matter. Their prophecies manifest as waking visions, astrological readings, cosmic energy pulses, or even direct conversations with their deities. While some prophets embrace their gift and serve as impartial messengers, others become overwhelmed by their prophecies, either in the hope of bringing their visions to fruition or in an attempt to stop some unfavorable future. These prophets often fall victim to exploitative opportunists who try to use them as a tool to foresee and manipulate the future.
