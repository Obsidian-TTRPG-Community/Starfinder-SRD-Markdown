# Heartbond - Level 1

**Source**:: _Galactic Magic pg. 92_  
**Script** Speak the Name (the names of the two individuals being bonded)  
**Assistants** none  
**Round Length** 1 hour

You create a magical bond between two willing creatures who share genuine affection for each other. As part of the ritual, both members of the bond receive a ring, amulet, or similar token to symbolize their shared connection; these items must each be worth at least 100 credits. When both individuals are wearing their tokens, they can, once per day as a standard action, sense the condition of the other as per the status spell. If either token is destroyed, the effect of the ritual ends.
