# Bodyguard Module (MAGIC)

**Price**::  24400

**Bulk**:: —  
This shield-shaped armor plate pulses with magical energy when another upgrade of the same type is nearby. When an ally within 30 feet who is also wearing a _bodyguard module_ takes damage, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to cause the target to take only half the damage, and you take the amount of damage not taken by the target. The damage you take can’t be negated, reduced, or redirected in any way. Forms of harm that do not involve Hit Points or Stamina Points, such as ability drain, charm effects, death effects, permanent negative levels, and temporary ability damage, are not affected.  
  
This upgrade can be installed only in heavy or powered armor.
