# Grenade Scrambler

When activated as a move action, this unit emits a wireless signal that interferes with the detonation sequence of grenades within 30 feet. Grenades that would successfully land at an intersection in the area have a 50% chance to miss, and any grenade that targets an intersection in the area and misses lands 1d6 squares away (instead of 1d4). A grenade scrambler affects only grenades whose item level is equal to or lower than its own level. If an affected grenade’s level is at least 5 levels lower than the grenade scrambler’s, it automatically misses.
