# DIEHARD
##  DIEHARD

**Source** _Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 156_  
You are especially hard to kill. Your wounds quickly stabilize when youâ€™re grievously wounded.

**Benefit**: When you are dying, you can spend the required Resolve Points to stabilize and 1 Resolve Point to stay in the fight (regaining 1 Hit Point) in the same round.

**Normal**: You must use Resolve Points to stabilize and to stay in the fight in separate rounds.
