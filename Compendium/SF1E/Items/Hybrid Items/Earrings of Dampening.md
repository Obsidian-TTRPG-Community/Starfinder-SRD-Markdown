# Earrings of Dampening

These small, silver earrings have sound waves etched onto their round faces. An integrated sensor in each detects vibrations and dampens sounds above a certain volume by emitting bursts of protective interference. The earrings trigger automatically when you attempt a saving throw against a sonic effect or would take sonic damage, granting a circumstance bonus to the saving throw and sonic resistance based on the earrings’ model. Once triggered, the earrings deactivate and can’t be used again until they recharge when you rest for 10 minutes to recover Stamina Points.
