# DRAGON (OUTER), OLD VOID DRAGON
Rarer than chromatic and metallic dragons, outer dragons are born and live in the vast depths of space, generally serving either their own inscrutable interests or those of some unknowable galactic force. As such, their actions can be especially frightening to the everyday citizens of the Pact Worlds and beyond. Even the methods by which outer dragons are born are shrouded in mystery. Some believe that outer dragons burst forth fully formed from the galaxy’s stars, with the void’s magic and energy coalescing into one mighty creature in an instantaneous moment of creation. Others think that outer dragons are manifestations of the universe’s will and come into being slowly, over the course of centuries, like a mote of matter might eventually become a star.

Outer dragons have forms similar to those of other true dragons, though their bodies are covered with more spiky protrusions, and their coloration patterns fluctuate as they move. Outer dragons have wings that allow them to move through vacuums and areas of no gravity with ease, thanks to some supernatural process that has yet to be fully understood.

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Obliterate (Su)** A creature that is reduced to 0 Hit Points by a void dragon’s bite attack must spend 1 Resolve point or be immediately slain and reduced to dust.

**Suffocating Breath (Su)** Instead of a cone of cold, a void dragon can breathe a 30-foot cone of energy that suffocates those it touches. Air-breathing creatures within the cone must succeed at a Fortitude save or begin attempting Constitution checks to avoid suffocation, even if they have environmental protections.

An affected creature can attempt a new Fortitude saving throw at the beginning of each turn to shake off this effect and regain its air supply.
