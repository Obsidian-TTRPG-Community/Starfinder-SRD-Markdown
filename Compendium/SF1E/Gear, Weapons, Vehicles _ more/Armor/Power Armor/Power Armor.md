# POWER ARMOR
Unlike light and [[Heavy Armor]], powered armor requires its own [[Battery]], and comes with a fully charged [[Battery]] at purchase. Powered armor uses the same type of batteries as other items, including charged [[Armaments]], and the [[Battery]] for a suit of powered armor can be recharged as normal using a generator or recharging station (see page 234), or it can be replaced with a new [[Battery]] when spent (see Table 7â€“9: Ammunition for [[Battery]] pricing).
