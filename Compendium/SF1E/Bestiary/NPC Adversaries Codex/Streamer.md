# Streamer

Celebrities shine in ways that often draw admiration, adoration, or amusement from fans across their home worlds and beyond. They regularly engage with fans through interviews, social media, and special appearances, boosting their sway in the court of public opinion. Some celebrities use their massive platforms to influence policy and elections, and it’s not uncommon for groups with specific political or corporate interests to secretly plant or sponsor celebrities to advance particular agendas.

### Special Abilities

**Relatable (Ex)** After spending at least 1 minute nonviolently interacting with a creature, a streamer develops a special rapport with that creature for 1d4 hours. If that creature attempts to directly attack the streamer while the rapport lasts, the creature must attempt a Will save (DC = 10 + the streamer’s CR). If the save fails, the creature can’t complete the attack, that part of its action is lost, and it can’t attempt to directly attack the streamer again for 1 round. If the save succeeds, the creature can attack the streamer normally for the duration of the rapport. If the streamer attacks the creature or one of the creature’s allies, the rapport ends.

## Description

Streamers present content live via digital platforms, attracting avid audiences that love these celebrities’ skill, conversation, idiosyncrasies, and knowledge. Streamed content might encompass anything from cooking hacks to gladiatorial home- and-garden tips for growing giant carnivorous plants like a pro. Streamers who provide content in public places sometimes catch unique footage of crimes or major events, becoming spontaneous journalists or invaluable witnesses. While these serendipitous recordings can earn a streamer fame, chronicling illicit activity can also create dangerous enemies.
