## DESCRIPTION

This spell functions as _lesser restoration_, except it also removes temporary negative levels or 1 permanent negative level. You must spend 5 Resolve Points when casting this spell to remove a permanent negative level. This spell can’t be used to remove more than 1 permanent negative level from a target in a 1-week period.  
  
_Restoration_ heals all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target, but it doesn’t remove any underlying source of fatigue or exhaustion. A target that has benefited from the removal of fatigue or exhaustion from this spell can’t benefit from either effect again for 24 hours.
