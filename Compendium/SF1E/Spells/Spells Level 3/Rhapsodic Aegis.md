## Description

_Rhapsodic aegis_, a spell devised by the battle musicians of ancient Pulonis, allows its caster to compose sonic energy into a protective barrier. Casting this spell grants you and each ally within range sonic resistance 5 and 10 temporary Hit Points. If lost, these temporary Hit Points can't be restored, and they don't stack with any other source of temporary Hit Points.
