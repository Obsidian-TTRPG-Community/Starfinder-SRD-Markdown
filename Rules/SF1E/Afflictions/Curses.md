# CURSES

Curses are magical [[Afflictions]] and usually have a single effect, though some curses use tracks like diseases and poisons do. Removing a curse requires either using _[[Remove Affliction]]_ or fulfilling a special condition that varies by curse (and sometimes differs between individual applications of the same curse).
