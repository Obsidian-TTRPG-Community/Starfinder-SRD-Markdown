### Description

These tough hiking boots include retractable ice spikes that provide crucial grip. As a move action, the wearer can click their heels together to extend or retract the spikes. While wearing the boots with extended spikes, your speed is reduced by 5 feet, but you can move across relatively even icy surfaces as though they were not difficult terrain, and the DCs for Acrobatics checks you attempt on ice are increased by 2 rather than 5.
