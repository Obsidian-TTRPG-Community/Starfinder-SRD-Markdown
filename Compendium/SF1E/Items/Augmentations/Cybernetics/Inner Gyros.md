# Inner Gyros

**Source**:: _Tech Revolution pg. 58_  
**Level**:: 4
**Price**::  2000 
**System**:: Ears  
Intricate instruments augment your inner ears, granting you an unshakable sense of balance and orientation. The augmentation grants you a +2 insight bonus to Acrobatics checks to balance and Piloting checks to perform stunts during starship combat. When an effect causes you to gain the flat-footed or off-kilter condition, you can spend 1 Resolve Point as a reaction to suppress that condition until the end of your next turn.
