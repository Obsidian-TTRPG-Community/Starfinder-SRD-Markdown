# Forked Pistol

Plasma builds up and arcs between the two long, notched tines of this pistol, amplifying in power as the stream travels the length of the weapon. Forked pistols are named for the number of notches in their plasma-generating forks, as each notch contributes to a more powerful blast. Pistols are typically available in 6-notch, 8-notch, 9-notch, and 10-notch models.

### Plasma Weapons

Superheated or electromagnetically charged gas becomes ionized plasma, which plasma weapons emit in a controlled blast. Ionized plasma deals both electricity and fire damage, tearing through organic flesh and metal alike. Plasma beams can be projected, as from a gun, or maintained in a steady beam with a powerful magnetic field, as the blade of a melee weapon.

Followers of Sarenrae popularized terms for the different intensities of plasma swords based on the heat they emit. The hottest, deadliest plasma weapon is a blue star, followed in descending order by white star, yellow star, red star, and finally tactical plasma weapons.
