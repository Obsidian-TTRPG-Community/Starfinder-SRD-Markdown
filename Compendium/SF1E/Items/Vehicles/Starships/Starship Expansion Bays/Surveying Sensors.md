# Surveying Sensors

**PCU**:: 3
**Cost (in BP)**:: 3  
This room of specialized analytical equipment and sensory technology augments a starship’s sensors when scanning planetary bodies, spatial anomalies, debris, and similar phenomena. When scanning such targets, the science officer doubles the bonus to Computers checks granted by the starship’s sensors (maximum +8). The surveying sensors also double the range of the starship’s sensors to 500 feet while in atmosphere or on planets. The augmented sensors provide no special benefits during starship combat.
