Each _elemental gem_ contains one elemental from a specific elemental plane. The gem’s color indicates the sort of elemental contained within—air gems are transparent, earth gems are brown, fire gems are orange, and water gems are blue. As a standard action, you can crush the gem, destroying it. The contained elemental then appears as if you had cast a _summon creature_ spell of a level and caster level according to the gem’s type.
