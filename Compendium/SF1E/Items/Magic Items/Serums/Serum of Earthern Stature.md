### Description

This chalky, khaki-colored liquid is incredibly dense and unpalatable to most species. For 1 hour after drinking a serum of earthen stature, you can’t be knocked [[prone]] (though you can still choose to become [[prone]]), and if an effect would move you, it moves you 10 feet fewer instead (to a minimum of 0 feet). These benefits function only when you’re touching a solid surface with at least one limb.
