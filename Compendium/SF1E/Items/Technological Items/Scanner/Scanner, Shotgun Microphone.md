### Description

A shotgun microphone amplifies your sense of hearing within a particular direction. You gain a +2 insight bonus to hearing-based Perception checks in a 60-foot cone, but you take a –2 penalty to hearing-based Perception checks from other areas. A shotgun microphone can record up to 12 hours of sound. You don’t need to take an action to use a shotgun microphone, but changing its direction requires a move action.
