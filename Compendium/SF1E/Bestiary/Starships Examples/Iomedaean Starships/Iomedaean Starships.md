# Iomedaean Starships

The battle against evil is not confined to planets, moons, and space stations. Those who venerate Iomedae know they must be ready to fight among the stars and hold a light against the constant darkness. Few other faiths have fleets that even approach the size of the Iomedaean navy. Like many of their other structures, the vessels used by the forces of Iomedae are meant to invoke a sense of purity and strength, with some of the largest looking like they are made from marble, with soaring buttresses and stained glass windows. The navy’s headquarters are at Absalom Station, and they often share ships or otherwise work in concert with the Knights of Golarion to keep humanity’s home safe from any danger. Iomedaean vessels are commissioned from a dedicated subsidiary of Sanjaval Spaceflight Systems called Inheritorworks.  
  
Divided up into 11 fleets (sometimes called Acts), the Iomedaean navy can respond to nearly any threat. Seven of the fleets are designated for general engagement, with enough vessels for system-wide maneuvers, as well as orbital and surface engagements. Of the remaining fleets, two are surface assault specialists, with vessels designed specifically to deploy ground-assault vehicles and troops. The final two fleets are for scouting and exploration, containing a smaller number of vessels with state-of-the-art sensors and fast engines for quick getaways.  
  
The forces of Iomedae sometimes find themselves in conflict with the Hellknights, as while both are trying to bring order to the galaxy, their approaches could not be more different. Although their differences have not yet escalated into a full-on war, the two forces have traded fire on more than one occasion. Even more remarkable is when the two groups work together to defeat a threat of pure chaos, such as the Cult of the Devourer.
