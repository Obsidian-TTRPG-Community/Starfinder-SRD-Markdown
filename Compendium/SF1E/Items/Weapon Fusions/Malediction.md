Effect: Once per day when you successfully attack a foe with a weapon with the _malediction_ fusion, as a reaction you can cast _bestow curse_ on the target as a spell-like ability (using the weapon’s item level as the caster level). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity. If the weapon with this fusion has an item level of 14 or higher you may use this ability twice per day, and if it has an item level of 19 or higher you may use this ability three times per day. A weapon cannot have the _malediction_ fusion if it also has either the _holy_ or _merciful_ weapon fusions.
