### Description

Designed to deal maximum damage, a monowhip is woven of monofilament fibers reinforced with carbon particles. Weighted at one end and spooled from a tough carbon-fiber grip, it delivers surgical-quality lacerations with minimal strength. The cuts delivered are so clean that victims sometimes fail to notice a severed limb until they are overwhelmed by a rush of blood loss.
