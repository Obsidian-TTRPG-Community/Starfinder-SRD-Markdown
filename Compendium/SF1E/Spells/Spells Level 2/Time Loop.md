# TIME LOOP
**Source** _Galactic Magic pg. 84_  
**Classes** Precog 2  
**School** conjuration  
**Casting Time** 1 standard action  
**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)  
**Targets** one creature  
**Duration** 1 round/level  
**Saving Throw** Will partial, see text; **Spell Resistance** yes

## DESCRIPTION

You immerse a creature in a time loop of your creation. The target sees and reacts to events that no longer coincide with the current timeline, becoming confused for 1 round and entangled for the duration. If the target succeeds at a Will saving throw to ignore the time loop, they're instead off-target for the duration.
