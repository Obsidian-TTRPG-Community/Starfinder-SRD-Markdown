## DESCRIPTION

You divert a malevolent spirit from the River of Souls to haunt your opponent’s armor. This spell must target a suit of light, heavy, or powered armor. The armor becomes cumbersome, reducing the wearer’s speed by 10 feet and AC by 1. It also rattles, hisses, and screeches, imposing a –4 penalty on Stealth checks.
