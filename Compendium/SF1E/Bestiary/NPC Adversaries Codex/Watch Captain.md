SPECIAL ABILITIES

#### Intimidating Authority (EX)

When a watch captain attempts to demoralize a target, they may exert their authority. If they succeed at their Intimidate check, the target is staggered for 1 round in addition to being shaken. This ability never causes the target to be staggered for more than 1 round. The watch captain may use this ability 4 times before requiring an 8-hour rest to use it again.

#### Requisition (EX)

A watch captain has access to almost any sort of equipment through their employer. Once per day, they may gain a specific piece of equipment with a level equal to or less than their CR in 10-60 minutes or a single piece of equipment with a level equal to their CR+1 in 1-6 hours. If the item is not consumable and is destroyed, they may not use this ability again for a number of days equal to the item’s level.

ABOUT

Watch captains are stern and canny veterans, experienced soldiers and law enforcement officers who have seen and done it all. Quick of mind and naturally suspicious, they are thorough and professional in leading investigations yet also tactful when dealing with rich and poor alike.
