# Overload Fusion 
(Su)
source: Galactic Magic pg. 33
You can drain power from offensive enchantments to explosive effect. When you hit a target with a weapon that has a weapon fusion or fusion seal, you can temporarily drain the magic from the fusion to increase the weapon’s damage dealt to one target by an amount equal to the weapon fusion’s or fusion seal’s item level. The fusion then ceases functioning until you regain Stamina Points as part of a 10-minute rest. A fusion can be drained in this way only once per day.
