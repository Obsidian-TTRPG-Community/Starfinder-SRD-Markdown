## Description

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Adjacent creatures are granted concealment against one another (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Otherwise, this fog provides total concealment (50% miss chance and attackers can’t use sight to locate targets).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

This spell doesn’t function underwater or in a vacuum.
