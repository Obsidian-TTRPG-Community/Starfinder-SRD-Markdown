# ELITE RESCUER
Emergency workers administer medical care, handle hazardous materials, evacuate disaster victims, and provide myriad other services in the wake of tragedy. They can be selfless idealists, exhausted municipal workers, or mercenaries who don’t lift a finger unless they’re under contract. Whatever their motivations, emergency workers are capable, resourceful, and tough, able to work long hours under difficult conditions.

### ECOLOGY

### SPECIAL ABILITIES

**On Your Feet (Ex)** When an elite rescuer uses Medicine to treat deadly wounds and exceeds the check’s DC by 5 or more, they also suppress one of the following conditions the target might have for 1d4 hours: dazzled, deafened, fatigued, nauseated, shaken, sickened, or staggered. Alternatively, the elite rescuer can reduce any movement speed penalty a target’s experiencing by 10 feet for 1d4 hours.

## DESCRIPTION

For disasters covering a huge area or with several victims, magically adept rescuers can use divinations and specialized senses to search for survivors. These experts often work alone, and must be fit enough to clamber over terrain, remove obstacles, and potentially carry their charges back to safety. 163
